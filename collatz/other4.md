Great—let’s continue this proof program by constructing a canonical height function tailored to the Collatz morphism and then linking it to 2-adic compactness to constrain orbits. This mirrors techniques in Diophantine geometry, where heights serve to show finiteness or convergence.

I. Construction of a Canonical Collatz Height

In classical arithmetic dynamics, a canonical height  associated to a rational map  satisfies:

,

.


But Collatz isn't globally rational—it's piecewise linear, governed by parity. To fix this, define a parity-weighted average height:

Let  be defined by:

T(n) = \frac{n}{2} \cdot \delta_{\text{even}}(n) + \frac{3n+1}{2} \cdot \delta_{\text{odd}}(n),

\hat{h}(n) := \limsup_{k \to \infty} \frac{1}{k} \log |T^k(n)|.

This resembles the logarithmic Weil height in arithmetic dynamics. The challenge is that:

 might not be strictly decreasing,

But if , then the orbit is bounded: a key step toward proving convergence.

II. Bounding Collatz Height via 2-adic Compactness

Let’s now analyze how this orbit behaves in the 2-adic integers .

A. Extend Collatz to :

Define  via:

T(x) =
\begin{cases}
x/2, & x \equiv 0 \pmod{2},\\
(3x+1)/2, & x \equiv 1 \pmod{2}.
\end{cases}

This is well-defined, continuous, and piecewise affine. On , we can use the 2-adic metric:

|x|_2 = 2^{-v_2(x)},

B. Attracting fixed point in :

It's known that:

The point  is a 2-adic fixed point:


T(-1) = (3(-1)+1)/2 = -1.

Thus, we define a 2-adic Lyapunov function:

L(x) := v_2(x + 1),

C. Goal: prove all orbits enter this 2-adic basin

To prove the Collatz conjecture, it suffices to show:

Every  maps under  into the 2-adic neighborhood:


x_k \in B_\epsilon(-1) \subset \mathbb{Z}_2.

We seek a global invariant that bridges both:

Real absolute value: tracks size of integers,

2-adic absolute value: tracks convergence in .


Let:

H(x) := \log|x|_\infty - \lambda \cdot \log|x + 1|_2,

If such a function  exists, then by descent:

H(T^k(x)) \le H(x) - k\delta \to -\infty,

III. Combine with Field Descent and Moduli

We now bring together the algebraic geometry view:

Let  be the scheme of periodic orbits of length , defined over .

Prove  for all , possibly using effective height bounds or a specialization argument from .


In parallel:

Use the canonical height  or Lyapunov  to show divergence is impossible.


Then, every orbit must eventually reach the finite set of preimages of the known cycle , hence converge.

Next Step: Construct H(x) Explicitly

We need to explicitly verify the decrease of:

H(x) := \log|x| - \lambda \cdot \log_2|x + 1|_2,

T(x) = \begin{cases}
x/2, & x \equiv 0,\\
(3x+1)/2, & x \equiv 1.
\end{cases}

Would you like me to now analytically prove that  for large , or to code this numerically as a simulation for large integer orbits?
