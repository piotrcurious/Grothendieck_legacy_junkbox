**Explanation:**

1. **TranscendentalComplex Class:**
   - Encapsulates a `std::complex<double>` to represent the complex number.
   - Overloads arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) to perform symbolic operations on these complex numbers. These operations are not evaluated immediately.

2. **Symbolic Operations:**
   - Create `TranscendentalComplex` objects for your transcendental numbers (e.g., `pi`, `e`).
   - Perform arithmetic operations on these objects. These operations are symbolic; they represent the mathematical expressions but don't involve actual numerical calculations yet.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - Use the `getValue()` method to retrieve the underlying `std::complex<double>` from each `TranscendentalComplex` object.
   - This triggers the actual numerical evaluation of the complex number, including any transcendental components.

**Key Points:**

- **Symbolic Representation:** The `TranscendentalComplex` class allows you to represent expressions involving transcendental numbers symbolically before performing numerical calculations.
- **Delayed Evaluation:** By delaying the evaluation to the `getValue()` call, you can potentially simplify expressions or optimize calculations before incurring the cost of evaluating transcendental functions.
- **Limitations:**
    - This approach still relies on approximations of transcendental numbers (e.g., `M_PI`).
    - Complex expressions involving multiple transcendental numbers can quickly become computationally expensive to evaluate.
    - This is a simplified example. For more complex scenarios, you might need a more sophisticated system for symbolic manipulation and expression simplification.

**Note:** This approach provides a basic framework. For real-world applications, you might need to consider more advanced techniques like:

- **Symbolic Computation Libraries:** Utilize libraries like GiNaC or SymPy for more powerful symbolic manipulation capabilities.
- **Expression Simplification:** Implement algorithms to simplify expressions before numerical evaluation.
- **Numerical Precision:** Carefully consider the precision requirements of your calculations and choose appropriate numerical methods.

This approach aims to strike a balance between symbolic representation and numerical computation, allowing you to work with transcendental numbers in a more structured and potentially more efficient manner.
