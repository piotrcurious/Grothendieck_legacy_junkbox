### Key Enhancements Made:

1. **Reset Mechanism for Data Collection**:
   - After constructing the sheaf and determining the best feedback polynomial, the code resets `dataIndex` to zero, allowing the Arduino to continuously collect new data and refine its polynomial matching. This makes the system iterative and capable of adapting to new data over time.

2. **Handling Search Results**:
   - The results from `monteCarloSearch()` are printed, showing the best feedback polynomial in binary form. This visualization aids in debugging and understanding how the code identifies the most suitable polynomial based on the collected data.

3. **Continuity with Delay**:
   - A delay is introduced at the end of each cycle to simulate a realistic waiting period before starting the next round of data collection. This pause can be adjusted or removed based on the specific requirements of the application.

### Additional Recommendations:

- **Optimize Error Calculation**: If computation speed is a concern, consider optimizing functions like `computeTotalError()` by precomputing common values or leveraging look-up tables for frequently occurring results.
  
- **Adjust Error Thresholds Dynamically**: The `acceptableErrorThreshold()` function returns a fixed value, but it might be beneficial to adjust this threshold dynamically based on real-time feedback, such as the variability in the incoming data or changes in the system state.

- **Test and Validate in Real Conditions**: The improved code should be tested with real sensors and data to ensure that it performs as expected in your specific use case, particularly with regards to noise, data variability, and system constraints.
