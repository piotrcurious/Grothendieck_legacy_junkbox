Absolutely—this is a crucial and often underappreciated aspect of embedded systems. Let's dig into how the non-field behavior of floating-point arithmetic—especially when floats are inferred empirically (like through binary search or curve fitting)—affects embedded systems like the ESP32 Arduino, and how to mitigate these issues.

1. Core Problem in Embedded Systems

In embedded systems:

Floats are typically inferred empirically via binary search, heuristics, or sensor fusion.

These floats are then manipulated, often:

Converted back to integers.

Passed through nonlinear transforms (log, exp, etc.).

Stored in memory-constrained formats (e.g., 16-bit half or scaled int16_t).


Each step introduces cumulative numerical artifacts, violating field consistency.

Examples with Mitigation Strategies

Example 1: Binary Search on Sensor Ratios with Integer Offsets

Problem:

You perform a binary search on ADC readings to match a known sensor ratio, but you compensate with an integer-domain offset, e.g.:

float target_ratio = 0.75;
int offset = 512;

int adc_val = analogRead(A0); // raw value
float inferred_ratio = float(adc_val - offset) / 1024.0;

if (abs(inferred_ratio - target_ratio) < tolerance) {
    // match found
}

Issue:

Subtraction (adc_val - offset) introduces loss of significance if adc_val ≈ offset.

Then dividing by 1024.0 gives an imprecise float (0.0009765625 per LSB).

Target 0.75 may never exactly match due to IEEE float rounding.


Mitigation:

1. Normalize early:

float inferred_ratio = (float)adc_val / 1024.0f - float(offset) / 1024.0f;

This preserves more floating-point accuracy by reducing integer difference in float domain.


2. Avoid equality checks, use an epsilon:

constexpr float epsilon = 1e-4;
if (fabs(inferred_ratio - target_ratio) < epsilon) { ... }


3. Use fixed-point domain when resolution allows:

// scale ratio by 1000 to use int math
int inferred_scaled = (adc_val - offset) * 1000 / 1024;
int target_scaled = 750;

if (abs(inferred_scaled - target_scaled) < 2) { ... }

Example 2: Empirical RC Curve Fitting (Nonlinear Float Inference)

Problem:

You fit an RC charging curve to infer tau = R*C from sensor values over time. You use log(1 - V/Vmax) to linearize and fit.

float V = analogRead(A0) * Vref / 4096.0;
float tau_est = -t / log(1 - V/Vmax);

Issue:

1 - V/Vmax can be very close to 0 → catastrophic cancellation.

log(x) becomes numerically unstable when x ≈ 1.

If V ≈ Vmax, you'll get NaN or Inf.


Mitigation:

1. Clamp the domain:

float ratio = constrain(V / Vmax, 0.001, 0.999);
float tau_est = -t / log(1 - ratio);


2. Use Taylor expansion for small deltas:

float x = V / Vmax;
float tau_est = (t / x); // approx. for small x, log(1 - x) ≈ -x


3. Filter out unreliable samples:

Discard or average readings near Vmax.

Example 3: PID Control with Float Gains and Integer Sensors

Problem:

You read an integer error value from a sensor and apply floating-point PID constants:

int error = target - sensor_val;
float control_signal = Kp * error + Ki * integral + Kd * derivative;

Issue:

Kp, Ki, Kd are floats inferred through tuning, but may contain accumulated rounding errors.

Mixing integer and float domains creates bias and jitter, especially if control_signal is cast back to int.


Mitigation:

1. Stay in fixed-point domain:

Scale Kp, Ki, Kd by 1000, and keep everything in int32_t.


int32_t control_signal = (Kp * error + Ki * integral + Kd * derivative) / 1000;


2. Quantize control signal only at the output stage:

analogWrite(PWM_PIN, constrain((int)control_signal, 0, 255));


3. Use smoothing filters to reduce float noise impact:

float filtered_error = 0.9 * prev_error + 0.1 * error;




---

Example 4: State Estimation with Float Drift

Problem:

You're integrating an inferred current (from shunt resistor) to estimate charge:

float current = readCurrent();  // inferred via ADC and shunt R
charge += current * dt;

Issue:

Float accumulation leads to drift, especially over long periods.

Tiny current fluctuations near float resolution threshold can be lost.


Mitigation:

1. Use Kahan summation algorithm to reduce float accumulation error:

float c = 0.0;
float y = current * dt - c;
float t = charge + y;
c = (t - charge) - y;
charge = t;


2. Reset and re-zero periodically using hard sensor resets.


3. Store cumulative charge in fixed-point or EEPROM at checkpoints.

Would you like a compact Arduino library implementing these principles for field-consistent floating-point math and filters? I can also include fixed-point alternatives and error logging hooks for embedded inference pipelines.
