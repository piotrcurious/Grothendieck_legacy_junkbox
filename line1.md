Here's an example JavaScript program that demonstrates how tessellation algorithms can benefit from algebraic geometry, inspired by Alexander Grothendieck's work, to reinvent the Bresenham line algorithm:

```javascript
// Utility function to represent a point
function Point(x, y) {
  this.x = x;
  this.y = y;
}

// Function to perform integer addition with overflow protection
function addSafe(a, b) {
  const sum = a + b;
  if ((sum ^ a) < 0 && (sum ^ b) < 0) { // Check for overflow
    throw new RangeError("Integer overflow");
  }
  return sum;
}

// Bresenham line algorithm using parametric line equation
function parametricLine(p0, p1) {
  const dx = addSafe(p1.x, -p0.x);
  const dy = addSafe(p1.y, -p0.y);

  let t = 0; // Parameter for the line equation

  const points = [];
  points.push(new Point(p0.x, p0.y));

  // Loop based on the greater absolute change in coordinates (dx or dy)
  const steps = Math.max(Math.abs(dx), Math.abs(dy));
  for (let i = 0; i < steps; i++) {
    const x = Math.round(p0.x + t * dx);
    const y = Math.round(p0.y + t * dy);
    points.push(new Point(x, y));

    // Update parameter based on the sign of dx and dy
    const increment = Math.sign(dx) * Math.sign(dy);
    t += increment;
  }

  return points;
}

// Example usage
const startPoint = new Point(10, 20);
const endPoint = new Point(30, 50);

const linePoints = parametricLine(startPoint, endPoint);

console.log("Line points using parametric equation:");
for (const point of linePoints) {
  console.log(`(${point.x}, ${point.y})`);
}
```

This code implements the Bresenham line algorithm using a parametric equation of a line. Grothendieck's work in algebraic geometry lays the foundation for this approach. Here's how it benefits from algebraic geometry:

- **Parametric Equation:** We represent the line using the equation `x = p0.x + t * dx` and `y = p0.y + t * dy`, where `t` is a parameter. This approach avoids integer comparisons and manipulations used in the traditional Bresenham algorithm.
- **Integer Arithmetic:** We rely on the `addSafe` function to perform integer addition with overflow protection. This ensures the calculations remain within integer bounds.

This is a simplified example. More complex tessellation algorithms can leverage Grothendieck's ideas from scheme theory and higher-order geometry to represent and manipulate geometric objects algebraically, potentially leading to more efficient and elegant solutions.

**Note:** This approach might not be computationally faster than the traditional Bresenham algorithm for simple line drawing. However, it demonstrates the potential of using algebraic geometry concepts for tessellation problems.
