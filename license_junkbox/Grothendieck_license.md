# AI-UBI SOFTWARE LICENSE
## Version 1.0, April 2025

## Preamble

"We explore... and you call us criminals. We seek after knowledge... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals." - The Hacker's Manifesto

"In our quest to understand the world and ourselves, we must remain vigilant against the commodification of knowledge and its separation from ethical purpose." - Inspired by Alexander Grothendieck

This license ("AI-UBI License") is designed to promote the ethical development and deployment of artificial intelligence technologies while contributing to economic equity through universal basic income initiatives. By using this license, developers acknowledge that technological advancement carries profound social responsibility—to ensure knowledge remains free, accessible, and directed toward collective benefit rather than concentrated power. 

Like Grothendieck's approach to mathematics, which sought to understand structures at their deepest foundations rather than through isolated problems, this license aims to address systemic inequalities at their root by ensuring the fruits of technological advancement are broadly shared across society.

## Definitions

1. **"Software"** refers to the program, code, documentation, and associated materials provided under this license.
2. **"Contributor"** means any individual or entity that creates, modifies, or contributes to the Software.
3. **"Recipient"** means any individual or entity that receives, uses, or redistributes the Software.
4. **"Commercial Use"** means any use of the Software that directly or indirectly generates revenue.
5. **"UBI Fund"** refers to the designated nonprofit organization(s) or trust(s) responsible for distributing funds in accordance with universal basic income principles.

## Fundamental Principles

### 1. Freedom of Exploration

In the spirit of the Hacker's Manifesto, this license affirms that curiosity and the pursuit of knowledge are fundamental human rights. Technology is a domain of intellectual exploration that should transcend arbitrary boundaries of nationality, ethnicity, wealth, or institutional affiliation.

### 2. Systems Over Symptoms

Following Grothendieck's mathematical philosophy of seeking deeper structures rather than isolated solutions, this license recognizes that technological inequality is a systemic issue requiring structural intervention. Universal Basic Income represents such a structural approach to ensuring that technological advancement benefits humanity broadly.

### 3. Responsibility of Creation

"To create is to take responsibility." Like Grothendieck's eventual retreat from institutional mathematics due to ethical concerns about its applications, this license acknowledges that creators bear responsibility for the social impacts of their work.

## Terms and Conditions

b) For Commercial Use, Recipients must prominently provide a link to access the source code or include instructions for obtaining it.

c) In the spirit of Grothendieck's belief in the free sharing of mathematical ideas, Recipients are encouraged to document design decisions, methodologies, and insights gained during development.

d) As the Hacker's Manifesto states, "we exist in the electron," recognizing that knowledge in digital form seeks to be free. This license affirms the right to explore and understand technology while establishing responsible frameworks for its use and benefit.

### 6. Patent License

Each Contributor hereby grants to Recipients a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Software, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Software to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

### 7. No Warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

b) The UBI Fund reserves the right to refuse contributions from Recipients using the Software in violation of these restrictions.

c) Following Grothendieck's example of refusing collaboration with military funding sources, Recipients are encouraged to consider the ultimate purpose and application of their work, not merely its technical elegance or commercial potential.

d) As expressed in the Hacker's Manifesto, technology should be judged by its exploration of possibility, not by superficial or commercial criteria: "We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals."

### 9. License Modifications

a) This License may be modified to address emerging concerns or opportunities by a governing body consisting of initial Contributors and UBI Fund representatives.

## UBI Fund Selection and Grothendieck-Inspired Governance

Initial Contributors shall designate one or more qualifying nonprofit organizations or establish a dedicated trust to serve as the UBI Fund. Reflecting Grothendieck's concern with the foundations of systems rather than their superficial manifestations, the governance structure must embody the principles it seeks to promote.

The criteria for selection include:

1. Demonstrated commitment to economic equity and systemic transformation
2. Transparent, non-hierarchical governance structure that includes voices of diverse stakeholders
3. Efficient fund distribution mechanisms that minimize bureaucracy
4. Geographic reach appropriate to the Software's user base, transcending national boundaries
5. Compliance with relevant financial regulations while working toward more equitable financial systems
6. Independence from military funding and surveillance capitalism enterprises
7. Commitment to ecological sustainability alongside economic transformation

In the spirit of Grothendieck's eventual retreat to focus on deeper foundations, the governance structure should regularly revisit its first principles and be willing to transform when those principles demand it.

## Epilogue: The Hacker Ethos and the Grothendieck Legacy

This license exists at the intersection of two powerful philosophical traditions:

From the Hacker's Manifesto, it inherits the belief that knowledge should be free, that exploration is a fundamental right, and that systems should be judged by their inherent qualities rather than arbitrary rules or commercial potential.

From Alexander Grothendieck, it inherits the commitment to understanding deep structures rather than surface phenomena, the courage to reimagine foundations when necessary, and the moral imperative to ensure our creations serve humanity and the planet rather than destructive forces.

"This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud." - The Hacker's Manifesto

"It's better to be lonely walking the right path than to follow the crowd walking the wrong path." - Inspired by Alexander Grothendieck
