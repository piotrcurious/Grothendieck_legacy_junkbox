How to Use the Lab:
​Riemann Surface Mode:
​Slider A controls the power k in z^k. Set it to 2.0 for a standard parabola, 3.0 for a Monkey Saddle.
​Slider B adds a linear tilt (Bz).
​Educational Insight: Watch how the "branch point" behavior changes at the origin as you increase the power. The colors represent the complex argument (phase).
​Dini Surface Mode:
​Slider A changes the radius/amplitude.
​Slider B controls the "twist" of the pseudosphere. If B is 0, it's a Tractroid. If B > 0, it twists.
​Educational Insight: Dini's surface is a surface of constant negative curvature. It is an isometric immersion of a portion of the Lobachevsky plane.
​Vector Field Mode:
​Shows a tangent field on a sphere.
​Slider A creates a flow from pole to pole.
​Slider B scales the magnitude of the vectors.
​Educational Insight: Try to make the vectors non-zero everywhere. You can't! This visually proves the Hairy Ball Theorem (you must have a cowlick/zero point somewhere).
