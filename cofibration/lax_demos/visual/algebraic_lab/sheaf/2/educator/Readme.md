Educational Features ExplainedThe "Stalk" (Fiber)Visual: The white vertical line intersecting the surface.Concept: In Sheaf theory, the stalk $\mathcal{F}_x$ at a point $x$ contains all possible "germs" at that point. Here, for $w^2 = z-A$, there are exactly two germs (points) in the stalk (unless $z=A$). The visualization shows both intersections as magenta dots.The "Germ" (Local Section)Visual: The cyan disk surrounding the active point on the surface.Concept: A germ is not just a value; it's a function element defined on a small open neighborhood $U$. The cyan disk represents $s(U)$, the image of a section. It shows that locally, the projection $\pi: E \to X$ is a homeomorphism (the disk on the surface looks exactly like the shadow disk on the base).Monodromy (Global vs Local)Action: Click "Start Animation". The cyan germ moves along the yellow circular path.Observation: If the Branch Point (Red Sphere) is inside the yellow loop, the germ will travel around and end up on the opposite sheet when it returns to the start.Lesson: This demonstrates that while the function is locally well-defined (as seen by the small cyan disk staying intact), it is not globally well-defined as a single function on $\mathbb{C} \setminus \{A\}$. The "Etale Space" (the whole surface) is the maximal domain where the function is well-defined and single-valued.
