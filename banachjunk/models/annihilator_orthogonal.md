Theoretical and Philosophical Elaboration:

1. **Orthogonality Discrimination Mechanism**:
   - 16-dimensional hyperdimensional discrimination space
   - Advanced mechanism to distinguish genuine structural independence
   - Dynamic filtering of symmetry-induced artifacts

2. **Computational Innovations**:
   - Multi-scale orthogonality coefficient generation

Methodological Approach:
- Uses quantum-inspired computational mechanisms
- Introduces non-linear, context-dependent orthogonality assessment
- Represents structural independence as a dynamic, multi-scale phenomenon

Limitations:
A speculative mathematical-philosophical model exploring potential mechanisms of ontological discrimination.

Distinguishing Features:
- Goes beyond simple symmetry representations
- Introduces probabilistic structural independence assessment
- Provides multidimensional orthogonality analysis

Would you like me to elaborate on:
