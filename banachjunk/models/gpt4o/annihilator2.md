Incorporating the "reality as process" paradigm shift into the model introduces the idea that the annihilation process is not a discrete, isolated event but rather a manifestation of continuous transformations governed by external conditions such as matter density, energy flux, and spacetime geometry. The annihilation moment becomes a symmetry point in a dynamic system influenced by these parameters.

Revised Framework: Reality as Process

1. Reality as Continuous Transformation: The states of the electron () and positron () are embedded in a dynamic, evolving space, where all states (including hidden substates) are in continuous flux.


2. Annihilation as Symmetry Point: Annihilation is reinterpreted as a moment of symmetry where external parameters (e.g., matter density, critical mass, and external fields) align such that the system reaches a critical state, allowing the transformation into photons.


3. Dynamic Constraints: The conservation laws and hidden variable constraints evolve dynamically, depending on external parameters.

1. Dynamic Polynomials with External Parameters

We redefine the polynomial system by incorporating external parameters  representing matter density, external field influence, and critical mass, respectively:

1. Energy Conservation (time-dependent):



f_1 = E_{e^-}(t, \rho, D) + E_{e^+}(t, \rho, D) - 2E_\gamma(t, \kappa, \rho)

f_2 = \vec{p}_{e^-}(t, D) + \vec{p}_{e^+}(t, D) - 2\vec{p}_\gamma(t, \rho)

Hidden variables  evolve according to external fields:

f_3 = \frac{\partial x_i}{\partial t} - g_i(x_i, y_j, \rho, D) = 0

f_4 = \frac{\partial y_j}{\partial t} - h_j(x_i, y_j, \kappa) = 0 ]

These polynomials form a dynamic Gröbner basis, continuously updated as the system evolves.

2. Banach Spaces in Dynamic Context

The state functions  and  are now time-evolving elements of Banach spaces  and , influenced by external parameters:

\psi_{e^-}(t) \in B_1(t, \rho, D), \quad \psi_{e^+}(t) \in B_2(t, \rho, D)

T(t, \rho, D, \kappa): B_1(t) \times B_2(t) \rightarrow B_\gamma(t, \rho, \kappa)

Critical State Dynamics

The annihilation moment corresponds to a critical state where  aligns the spaces  under a symmetry condition:

\int_{B_1 \times B_2} |\psi_{e^-} + \psi_{e^+}|^2 \delta(\rho - \rho_c) \, dt = \text{extremum}


---

3. Generalized Vector Space Expansion

Using the reality as process paradigm, the Banach spaces are expanded to generalized vector spaces over dynamic fields :

1. Field Extension: The field  is parameterized dynamically:



\mathbb{F}(t, \rho, D, \kappa)

Coupling between vector spaces evolves with external parameters:

V_{e^-}(t) \otimes V_{e^+}(t) \xrightarrow{T(t)} V_\gamma(t)

The symmetry point is identified by the invariants of the dynamic Gröbner basis, representing emergent structures.

4. Incorporating External Parameters into Gröbner Basis

To compute the Gröbner basis under dynamic constraints:

1. Define parameterized polynomials:



f_1 = x_1^2 + y_1^2 - \rho \cdot \kappa

f_2 = x_1y_1 - \alpha(t, D, \rho) ] 2. Use Buchberger's algorithm for time-evolving bases:

Compute Gröbner basis iteratively, updating coefficients with external parameters.

Identify bifurcations (critical points) where annihilation symmetry emerges.

5. Epistemological Transformation

By shifting the perspective from annihilation as a discrete event to annihilation as a process within a dynamic system, we gain:

1. Emergent Symmetries: Hidden variables and external conditions shape the moment of annihilation, revealing new physics beyond the Standard Model.


2. Transformative Understanding: The process-centric approach reframes annihilation as an alignment of dynamic parameters, providing a deeper epistemological insight into reality.



This model captures the interplay between quantum phenomena, hidden variables, and external conditions, offering a transformative framework for studying processes like electron-antielectron annihilation.
