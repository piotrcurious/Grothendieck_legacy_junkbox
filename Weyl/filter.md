Below is one example of ESP32 Arduino code that “demonstrates” how one might use ideas from the Weyl algebra (that is, the Weyl quantization of a symbol) to implement a band‐splitting filter. (Keep in mind that this is a toy example intended to illustrate the concept rather than production‑quality DSP code.)

In the code below we:

1. Generate a small “signal” (an array of 32 samples) that is a sum of two sine waves (one low‑frequency and one high‑frequency).


2. “Filter” the signal by applying a discretized version of a Weyl–quantized operator whose symbol is an indicator function selecting either the low–frequency or high–frequency band. In the continuous theory one would write the operator as



  

Au(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int \int e^{i(x-y)\xi}\,a\Big(\frac{x+y}{2},\xi\Big) u(y)\,dy\,d\xi,

with the symbol   

a\Big(\frac{x+y}{2},\xi\Big)=\begin{cases} 1,&|\xi|<\xi_c\quad (\text{low band})\\ 0,&|\xi|\ge\xi_c \end{cases}

(or vice‐versa for the high–band operator). Here we mimic that by replacing the integrals with discrete sums over time (index y) and frequency (index k).

3. Print the input signal along with the low–band and high–band outputs.



Because the Weyl operator is built from the time–frequency shift operators (which satisfy the Weyl algebra’s commutation relations), this example “implements” a band–splitting filter by summing over all time shifts and (discrete) frequencies with the appropriate phase factors.

Below is the complete code:


---

#include <Arduino.h>
#include <math.h>

#define N 32                      // Number of samples (keep it small for demo)
#define PI 3.14159265358979323846

// Cutoff frequency (normalized): frequencies with |xi| < cutoff go to the low–band.
const float cutoff = 0.2;         // Adjust as needed

// Input signal array (length N)
float inputSignal[N];
// Output arrays for low–band and high–band signals
float lowBandSignal[N];
float highBandSignal[N];

/*
  applyWeylFilter()

  This function implements a discrete version of the Weyl–quantized operator.
  For a given sample index x_index, it computes

     output(x_index) = (1/(N^2)) * sum_y sum_k [ input[y] * exp(i 2pi (x_index - y)*xi) ]
     
  but only includes the frequency components xi that lie in the desired band:
    - if lowBand is true, include frequencies with |xi| < cutoff.
    - if lowBand is false, include frequencies with |xi| >= cutoff.

  (For simplicity we use only the real part (cosine) and assume the signal is real.)

      // To get symmetric (negative and positive) frequencies,
      // shift the index when k > N/2.
      int k_shifted = (k <= N/2) ? k : k - N;
      float xi = (float)k_shifted / N;  // normalized frequency
      
      // Decide whether to include this frequency in the filter
      bool include = false;
      if (lowBand) {
        if (fabs(xi) < cutoff)
          include = true;
      } else {

        sum += input[y] * cos(phase);
      }
    }

A Few Notes on This Example

1. Weyl Quantization Idea:
In modern analysis the Weyl quantization maps a “symbol”  to an operator  by integrating the time–frequency shifted (Weyl) operators. In our example, we choose



a(x,\xi)=\begin{cases}1,& |\xi|<\text{cutoff} \\ 0,& |\xi|\ge\text{cutoff}\end{cases}

2. Discretization:
The continuous integrals are replaced by finite sums over  time samples and  frequency bins. We “symmetrize” the frequency variable so that negative frequencies are included.


3. Performance:
This double (in fact triple, when you consider the outer loop over ) summation is not efficient. For a real application you would use optimized FFT-based methods. However, the point here is to illustrate the connection between the Weyl algebra (time–frequency shifts) and a band–splitting filter.


4. ESP32 Limitations:
The example uses a very small  (32) to keep computation times short. For a more realistic signal you would need to optimize the computation or pre‐compute the filter kernels.



Compile and upload this code to your ESP32 using the Arduino IDE (or PlatformIO), open the Serial Monitor, and you should see the input signal along with its low and high frequency components as computed via our “Weyl–algebra” filter.

This example should give you a starting point for exploring more advanced ideas from Weyl algebra in signal processing on embedded platforms.
