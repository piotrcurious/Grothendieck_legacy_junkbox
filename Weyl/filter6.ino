/*
  ESP32 Weyl Algebra Quantization Filter Example
  ------------------------------------------------
  This example demonstrates a conceptual implementation of a band‐splitting filter 
  that “extracts” the lower frequency band by representing part of the FFT spectrum 
  as a polynomial over the field of quantized samples. (Recall that the ADC sampling 
  already quantizes the signal by the Nyquist limit.) 
  
  We then define simple polynomial operations analogous to the Weyl algebra:
    • “Multiplication by X” (which shifts the polynomial’s coefficients), 
    • “Differentiation” (approximated by finite differences on the polynomial coefficients), 
    • and a Weyl–operator Q = (X · poly – d/dX poly).
  
  Finally, we “reduce” the resulting polynomial (a stand–in for a Groebner basis reduction)
  to keep only the lower–order (i.e. lower frequency) terms.
  
  This sketch is meant for demonstration and conceptual purposes.
