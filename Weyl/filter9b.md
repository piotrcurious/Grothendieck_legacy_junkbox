Below is one way to refine the “algebraic‐field” model so that we use a more rigorous ring structure—and we implement most of the operations using fixed‐point (integer) arithmetic. This approach reduces round‐off errors and “floating‐point drift” when modeling the quantized field and applying Weyl operators. In our revised model, we “lift” ADC readings into a fixed-point ring (a subring of the rationals with a fixed denominator) that approximates a finite field. (In a fully rigorous implementation one might use a prime field such as GF(p), but here we use fixed-point arithmetic to stay compatible with typical microcontroller hardware while still emphasizing the ring structure.)

The key changes are:

1. Finite Ring Methodology:
– Instead of a simple “rounding” function, we convert the (normalized) ADC value into a fixed-point integer with a chosen number of fractional bits (here, 16).
– All arithmetic on our “field elements” is done in this ring. Because the operations are integer based, the results remain exactly in our discrete ring (subject to overflow‐care).


2. Improved Numerical Stability:
– By using fixed-point (and thus integer) arithmetic for the field operations (addition, multiplication, etc.), we reduce the error that would otherwise accumulate when using native floating‑point arithmetic.
– We “normalize” frequency (and other parameters) into the same fixed-point format so that the Weyl algebra operator (which we model here as a simple polynomial in  and its finite-difference “derivative”) and the algebraic geometry constraint (here ) are computed in our fixed-point ring.



The following Arduino/ESP32 code is a demonstration of this revised methodology. (Note that many of these operations are illustrative; in a more complete implementation one would add overflow protection and further refinement of the Weyl operator model.)

Explanation of the Revisions

1. Finite Ring Representation via Fixed-Point:
We now “lift” each ADC sample into a fixed-point number with 16 fractional bits. This fixed-point type represents our field elements and defines a ring with well-controlled addition and multiplication. In contrast to the earlier simple rounding method, this approach ensures that all operations (including our custom Weyl operator and the polynomial filter) remain closed in our ring.


2. Improved Arithmetic Stability:
Using integer arithmetic for multiplication (with appropriate bit shifts) helps avoid many of the pitfalls of floating-point operations on microcontrollers. The helper functions (double_to_fixed, fixed_to_double, q_mul, and q_div) encapsulate the fixed-point arithmetic and provide a stable and efficient means to perform our algebraic operations.


3. Methodology of the Rings Used:
The original approach “quantized” the ADC values by simple rounding. Here, we interpret those values as elements of a ring (a subring of the rational numbers with denominator ). This choice guarantees that our Weyl algebra operator (modeled as ) and our algebraic constraint () are computed in a structured manner. Although this demo still uses simplified operators, the methodology now explicitly treats these operations as elements of a fixed ring, which improves clarity and numerical robustness.


4. Practical Considerations:
While this code demonstrates improved numerical stability via fixed-point arithmetic, note that in a production system you may wish to add overflow checking, use a prime field (if invertibility is essential), or further refine the operators to match your precise application.

This updated implementation should offer a more stable and mathematically consistent demonstration of using ring-based field operations and Weyl algebra operators in the frequency domain on an ESP32 platform. If you need additional refinements or more advanced ring/field models (such as using a true finite field GF(p)), let me know.
