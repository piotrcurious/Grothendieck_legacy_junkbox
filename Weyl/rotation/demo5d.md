The Role of Discrete Weyl Algebra in Rotation CorrectionIn this simulation, we are working with a discrete and modular phase space. The ModularWeylXOperator (X) and ModularWeylPOperator (P) act as discrete analogues of quantum mechanical position and momentum operators. They perform cyclic shifts on the rows and columns of the matrix, respectively.Non-Commutativity:A key concept in quantum mechanics and the associated Weyl algebra is that position and momentum operators do not commute, famously expressed as [P, X] = PX - XP = -iÄ§. This non-commutativity is fundamental and leads to phenomena like the uncertainty principle.In our discrete, modular system, these operators also generally do not commute. Applying a row shift then a column shift (P(X(matrix))) yields a different result than applying a column shift then a row shift (X(P(matrix))).Quantifying the Effect:The function estimate_quantization_effect_modular calculates the difference matrix D = P(X(matrix)) - X(P(matrix)) and returns its Frobenius norm, Q = ||D||_F.If X and P commuted perfectly, D would be a zero matrix, and Q would be 0.A larger value of Q indicates a greater degree of non-commutativity for the given matrix and quantization level (shift amount).Connection to Correction:Transformations like rotation on a discrete grid can introduce artifacts. The non-commutativity of the fundamental operators (X, P) can be seen as one source contributing to these discretization effects.The LemmaBasedCorrectionStrategy directly uses this measure of non-commutativity (Q) to try and mitigate these effects before rotation:It calculates a scaling factor: scale = 1.0 - correction_factor * Q.It creates a correction matrix C = Identity * scale.This correction matrix C is applied to the original matrix (C @ matrix) before the standard rotation (rotate_matrix_around_center) is performed.Essentially, this strategy assumes that a larger deviation from commutativity (Q) requires a stronger corrective scaling (closer to zero if correction_factor * Q approaches 1) applied uniformly to the matrix before attempting the rotation. The visualization display_weyl_commutation explicitly shows the matrices PX, XP, and their difference D, illustrating the non-commutativity quantified by Q.
