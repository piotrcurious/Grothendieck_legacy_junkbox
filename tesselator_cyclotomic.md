Certainly! Below is a simple Tcl/Tk program that demonstrates tessellation using algebraic geometry concepts, specifically cyclotomic polynomials. This example will not delve deeply into Alexander Grothendieck's works but will use the concept of cyclotomic polynomials to find roots for a simple tessellation pattern. The program creates a window and draws a tessellated pattern using 3rd order polynomials.

```tcl
#!/usr/bin/env tclsh

package require Tk

# Function to calculate the roots of the 3rd order polynomial using cyclotomic polynomials
proc calculate_roots {} {
    # Coefficients of the 3rd order polynomial: ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0
    set a 1
    set b -3
    set c 3
    set d -1

    # Calculate the roots using cyclotomic polynomials (simplified)
    # The roots of the polynomial x^3 - 1 = 0 are the cube roots of unity: 1, -0.5 + i(√3/2), -0.5 - i(√3/2)
    set roots [list 1 [complex -0.5 0.86602540378] [complex -0.5 -0.86602540378]]
    return $roots
}

# Function to draw the tessellation
proc draw_tessellation {canvas width height} {
    set roots [calculate_roots]
    set offsetX 200
    set offsetY 200
    set scale 100
    
    # Draw the base points
    foreach root $roots {
        set x [expr {[lindex $root 0] * $scale + $offsetX}]
        set y [expr {[lindex $root 1] * $scale + $offsetY}]
        $canvas create oval [expr {$x - 3}] [expr {$y - 3}] [expr {$x + 3}] [expr {$y + 3}] -fill black
    }

    # Create tessellated pattern based on roots
    for {set i 0} {$i < 5} {incr i} {
        for {set j 0} {$j < 5} {incr j} {
            foreach root $roots {
                set x [expr {[lindex $root 0] * $scale + $offsetX + $i * $scale}]
                set y [expr {[lindex $root 1] * $scale + $offsetY + $j * $scale}]
                $canvas create oval [expr {$x - 3}] [expr {$y - 3}] [expr {$x + 3}] [expr {$y + 3}] -fill black
            }
        }
    }
}

# Main program
proc main {} {
    wm title . "Tessellation with Cyclotomic Polynomials"
    set canvas [canvas .c -width 600 -height 600 -background white]
    pack $canvas -fill both -expand true
    
    draw_tessellation $canvas 600 600
}

# Initialize complex number representation
proc complex {real imag} {
    return [list $real $imag]
}

main
```

### Explanation
1. **Cyclotomic Polynomial Roots Calculation**:
   - The `calculate_roots` function finds the roots of a simplified cyclotomic polynomial \( x^3 - 1 = 0 \), which are 1 and the two complex cube roots of unity.

2. **Drawing the Tessellation**:
   - The `draw_tessellation` function uses these roots to create a repeating pattern. The pattern's basic units are placed based on these roots, scaled, and offset for visual clarity.
   - The tessellation is repeated over a 5x5 grid for simplicity.

3. **Main Function**:
   - The `main` function sets up the Tk canvas and calls the tessellation drawing function.

This is a simplified demonstration. For a more accurate representation of Grothendieck's algebraic geometry applied to tessellation, one would need a deeper and more intricate implementation considering various algebraic structures and boundaries.
