Here is the same theorem with the machinery unpacked from the bottom up.

A complex projective variety is just a geometric shape cut out by polynomial equations, but sitting in projective space rather than ordinary affine space. A hyperplane is the simplest possible slice: one linear equation. A hyperplane section  is what you get when you intersect your shape  with that slice. The article assumes the slice is chosen generically enough that the leftover open set  is smooth, meaning the cut is not hitting any pathological singular behavior. 

Now for the maps. The inclusion  gives you a way to compare topology. In homology, you think of a -dimensional cycle as a -dimensional “loop-like object” or “hole detector,” and the inclusion sends such a cycle in the slice to the same cycle viewed inside the bigger space. In cohomology, the direction reverses because cohomology is pulled back from the bigger space to the smaller one: a cohomology class on  can be restricted to . In homotopy, you compare maps from spheres into the spaces, again transported by inclusion. 

The theorem’s content is: for a complex -dimensional projective variety , slicing by a generic hyperplane does not change the topology in low degrees. More precisely, for , the homology map  is an isomorphism, and at  it is surjective; dually,  is an isomorphism for  and injective at ; and the same pattern holds for homotopy groups . 

Translated into plain geometry: if you cut a nice complex shape by one generic hyperplane, then all the “small” topological features are already visible in the slice. Nothing new happens below the middle threshold . The first degree where new topology can appear is exactly that borderline degree. That is why the theorem is often read as “a generic hyperplane section captures the low-dimensional topology of the original variety.” 

There is also a cleaner way to say the same thing using relative groups. Relative homology  measures the part of ’s topology that is not already explained by . The theorem says those relative groups vanish for , which means there is no genuinely new low-degree topology hiding in the pair . The article notes that this relative-vanishing formulation is equivalent to the usual homology, cohomology, and homotopy statements above. 

A concrete case helps. If  has complex dimension , then  is a complex curve. The theorem says  is an isomorphism, so connectedness is preserved, and  is surjective, so every 1-dimensional cycle in  already comes from the slice. This is a good way to remember the pattern: slicing by one hyperplane preserves everything below the “middle” degree. 

If you want, I can next rewrite the theorem line by line in a “dictionary style” where every symbol like , , and “isomorphism” is explained without using any abstract topology jargon.
