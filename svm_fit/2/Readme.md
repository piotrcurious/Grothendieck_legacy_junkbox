Sure! Here’s the regenerated prompt for the next conversation:

Prompt:
Create an ESP32 Arduino code that fits a polynomial to incoming data in timestamp/value format, dynamically adjusts the polynomial degree to detect significant divergence in the data, and predicts the system's future evolution. The system should:

1. Fit polynomials using the least squares method.


2. Continuously monitor residuals to detect significant divergence based on a Gaussian noise assumption.


3. Dynamically increase the polynomial degree when divergence is detected, up to a predefined maximum degree.


4. Handle incoming data points in real time and refine the fit iteratively.


5. Predict future values based on the refined polynomial model.



Ensure the code supports modular development for enhancements, including:

Improved divergence detection mechanisms.

Additional prediction methods.

Logging of residuals and polynomial adjustments.
