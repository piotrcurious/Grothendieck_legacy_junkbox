Here's the refined prompt incorporating your detailed requirements:

Prompt:
Create an ESP32 Arduino code that fits a polynomial to incoming data in timestamp/value format, dynamically adjusts the polynomial degree to detect significant divergence in the data, and predicts the system's future evolution. The system should:

1. Fit polynomials using the least squares method.


2. Implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based model where:

The candidate polynomial divides the data into two feature sets (data points above and below the polynomial).

The quality of the division is analyzed iteratively to refine the polynomial for optimal separation.

Boundary support vectors are used for higher-precision evaluation compared to data points.



3. Continuously monitor residuals and division quality to infer necessary polynomial adjustments.


4. Dynamically increase the polynomial degree if the quality of fit significantly deteriorates, up to a predefined maximum degree.


5. Handle incoming data points in real time, refining the polynomial and division iteratively.


6. Predict future values based on the refined polynomial model.



Ensure the system is modular to facilitate enhancements, including:

Advanced SVM-based division quality analysis.

Dynamic adjustment strategies for refining candidate polynomials.

Efficient logging and reporting mechanisms for residuals, feature set distributions, and polynomial updates.
