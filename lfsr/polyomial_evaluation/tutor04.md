 Certainly! I'll extend the code to work with polynomials over the finite field GF(8), which is a field with 8 elements. This field is typically represented as GF(2^3), as it's an extension of GF(2) of degree 3.

This extended code now works with polynomials over GF(8). Here are the key changes and additions:

1. `GF8` class: Represents elements of GF(8). We implement GF(8) as GF(2)[x]/(x^3 + x + 1).

2. Updated `Polynomial` class: Now works with GF(8) elements instead of GF(2).

3. Modified `polynomial_to_lfsr` function: The feedback polynomial is now x^5 + a_5, where a_5 is the leading coefficient of the input polynomial.

4. Updated `run_lfsr` function: Now performs calculations in GF(8).

5. Modified `main` function: Generates a random polynomial over GF(8), converts it to an LFSR, runs the LFSR, and verifies the output.

Key points to note:

1. GF(8) has 8 elements: {0, 1, α, α^2, α^3, α^4, α^5, α^6}, where α is a root of the primitive polynomial x^3 + x + 1.

2. In our implementation, we represent these elements as integers from 0 to 7, where 2 (binary 010) is chosen to represent α.

3. The LFSR now generates a sequence that matches the values of the polynomial at consecutive powers of α (represented by 2 in our implementation).

4. The verification step checks that P(α^i) matches the i-th output of the LFSR for i = 0, 1, 2, ..., 19.

This implementation demonstrates how LFSRs can be used to evaluate polynomials over larger finite fields, not just GF(2). The principles remain the same, but the arithmetic becomes more complex.

You can run this code to see how it works with different random polynomials over GF(8). Feel free to experiment with different polynomial degrees or even extend it to other finite fields.

Would you like me to explain any part of this implementation in more detail or discuss how it could be further generalized?
