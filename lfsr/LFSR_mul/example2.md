To improve the example for higher-degree finite fields (GF) in the context of signal analysis, we can focus on extracting features such as derivatives, periods, and other key properties from the LFSR sequences. Weâ€™ll use the previously implemented LFSR multiplier to combine sequences, perform polynomial multiplication, and analyze the results in higher-degree fields such as GF(16) or GF(256). This allows for more complex signal generation and analysis, where we can detect signal features by analyzing the resulting sequences' properties like their periodicity or rate of change (derivatives).

Key Concepts:

1. LFSR Multiplier: We will use the previously created polynomial multiplier to combine LFSR sequences.


2. Higher-Degree GF: We move beyond GF(2) into GF(16) and GF(256) for richer signal behavior.


3. Signal Analysis:

Derivatives: Calculate the first and second derivatives of the generated sequences to analyze their change over time.

Periodicity: Detect the period of sequences generated by LFSRs, both individually and after combining them.

Feature Extraction: Extract features such as frequency components, sudden changes, or unique patterns in the sequences.




Code Improvement: Higher-Degree GF, Derivatives, and Feature Extraction

The following code extends the original example by adding support for signal analysis of LFSRs in higher-degree Galois Fields (GF). It incorporates methods for deriving signal features such as derivatives and periodicity using LFSR sequences combined via the multiplier.

Code Explanation and Features:

1. Higher-Degree GF (GF(16)) Multiplication:

polyMulGF() is a more general version of the polynomial multiplication function that works over fields like GF(16). The multiplication is performed with modular reduction using the field's defining polynomial (e.g.,  for GF(16)).

The multiplyLFSRs() function multiplies two LFSR sequences in GF(16), using the polynomial multiplication function and a mod polynomial for reduction.



2. Signal Derivatives:

polyDerivativeGF2() calculates the first derivative of a polynomial in GF(2), where each term  is reduced to  (mod 2).

analyzeDerivatives() computes the first and second derivatives of an LFSR sequence, which can reveal how the signal is changing over time, helping in signal analysis or feature extraction.

This can be useful in periodicity detection, where the derivative will help identify the rate of change in the sequence, and potentially the period.



3. Signal Analysis:

The code now analyzes both the cyclotomic and primitive LFSRs using the derivatives.

For GF(16) sequences, the code multiplies two LFSR sequences, which can be viewed as combining two signal sources to analyze their resulting signal in a higher-order field.




Output Analysis:

The ESP32 will output the sequences, their derivatives, and the results of multiplying two LFSR sequences over GF(16). You can observe how the derivatives change and how combining the LFSRs via multiplication results in more complex sequences.
