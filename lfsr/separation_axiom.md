Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs) are widely used in various applications like cryptography, error detection, and pseudo-random number generation. The mathematical relationship between an LFSR and its feedback polynomial is essential to understanding how LFSRs function.

### 1. **Overview of LFSRs and Feedback Polynomials**

- **LFSR**: An LFSR is a shift register whose input bit is a linear function of its previous state. The most common function used is the XOR (exclusive OR). An LFSR with \( n \) stages can be described by a state vector \( S(t) = [s_0(t), s_1(t), \ldots, s_{n-1}(t)] \), where \( s_i(t) \) represents the state of the \( i \)-th register at time \( t \).

- **Feedback Polynomial**: The feedback polynomial \( P(x) \) associated with an LFSR is a binary polynomial that determines which bits of the LFSR contribute to the feedback loop. If the LFSR has \( n \) stages, the feedback polynomial is typically expressed as:

  \[
  P(x) = x^n + c_{n-1}x^{n-1} + \ldots + c_1x + c_0
  \]

  where \( c_i \) are coefficients that are either 0 or 1. The coefficient \( c_i \) determines whether the \( i \)-th bit of the LFSR is included in the feedback calculation.

### 2. **Separation Axiom Theory**

The Separation Axiom in topology refers to certain properties that separate points and sets within a topological space, ensuring the space meets specific conditions like T0, T1, or T2 (Hausdorff) separations.

However, when discussing LFSRs in the context of a "separation axiom," we consider the separation of different states within the state space of the LFSR based on the feedback polynomial. This can be connected to properties of the polynomial such as minimal polynomials, irreducibility, and primitive polynomials.

### 3. **Mathematical Relationship Using Separation Axiom**

- **State Space Separation**: Consider the set of all possible states of the LFSR, which can be viewed as elements in a vector space over \( GF(2) \) (Galois Field of order 2). The feedback polynomial defines a transformation on this vector space.

- **Irreducibility and Primitive Polynomials**: If the feedback polynomial \( P(x) \) is irreducible over \( GF(2) \), then the state space can be separated into orbits under the transformation defined by the LFSR. A primitive polynomial will ensure that the LFSR has a maximal-length sequence, which separates the state space into a single cycle (except for the all-zero state).

  - **T0 Separation**: In this context, a T0 separation implies that distinct states in the LFSR produce different outputs. This is guaranteed if the feedback polynomial is non-degenerate (i.e., not reducible).

  - **Hausdorff (T2) Separation**: Analogous to Hausdorff separation in topology, in the LFSR context, it could be seen as ensuring that distinct initial states in the LFSR evolve into distinct future states. This is strictly ensured when the feedback polynomial is primitive.

- **Minimal Polynomial and Separation**: The minimal polynomial of the LFSRâ€™s characteristic polynomial also plays a role in separating the state space into distinct orbits. If the minimal polynomial divides the feedback polynomial, it determines the structure of these orbits (cycles in the LFSR sequence).

### 4. **Summary**

In essence, the feedback polynomial of an LFSR defines a transformation on the state space of the register. The nature of this polynomial (irreducible, primitive) controls the separation of states within this space, ensuring distinct and non-overlapping cycles in the state evolution (akin to separation axioms in topology). The mathematical relationship between an LFSR and its feedback polynomial can be viewed through this lens of separation, where the polynomial properties determine how states are distinguished and evolve over time.
