Introduction

Polynomial fitting and feature extraction are mathematical techniques used to model data and analyze its underlying patterns. Integrating the ideas of Alexander Grothendieck (fields, sheaf theory) and Évariste Galois (field extensions, group theory) adds theoretical depth, focusing on the field nature of numbers and the intrinsic polynomial structure of mathematical objects.

The Concept: Numbers as Polynomials

In abstract algebra, any number can be considered as a root of a polynomial over some field. For example:

Rational numbers are roots of linear polynomials over  (e.g., ).

Algebraic numbers (e.g., ) are roots of polynomials with integer coefficients.

Transcendental numbers (e.g., ) extend beyond this, but are approximated polynomially.


Thus, any dataset, consisting of timestamp-value pairs, can be mapped to polynomials by:

1. Treating timestamps as an ordered field.


2. Representing values as coefficients/roots of a polynomial over this field.



Grothendieck's Perspective

Grothendieck’s methods focus on structural elegance and universality:

Sheaf Theory: Information at local patches (subsets of a dataset) combines into a global structure.

Field Extensions: Analyze the dataset using polynomial mappings and structure-preserving morphisms (e.g., linear transformations).


These principles suggest breaking a dataset into local, polynomial approximations that can be unified into a global model.

Galois Theory's Contribution

Galois theory connects polynomials to symmetry through field extensions. Key ideas:

1. Symmetries in the dataset (e.g., repeating patterns or periodicity) correspond to automorphisms of the polynomial's field.


2. Feature extraction identifies invariants under these automorphisms.



This aligns with detecting features like trends or periodic patterns in timestamp-value datasets.

Advantages

1. Simplification: By treating data as polynomials, you reduce the complexity of its structure into manageable algebraic forms.


2. Universality: The methodology applies uniformly to various datasets, whether they follow linear trends, quadratic growth, or complex periodicity.


3. Elegance: Reflecting Grothendieck’s philosophy, the approach unifies local and global perspectives.

Theoretical Framework for Python Code

1. Dataset Representation

Consider a dataset of timestamp-value pairs:

D = \{(t_i, v_i) \,|\, t_i \in \mathbb{R}, v_i \in \mathbb{R}\}

2. Feature Detection

Features include:

Trend: Global behavior (e.g., linear or quadratic growth).

Periodicity: Cyclic patterns detectable by symmetry groups.

Anomalies: Outliers as deviations from polynomial predictions.


3. Polynomial Fitting

Using a least-squares method, fit a polynomial  to the dataset:

P(t) = a_0 + a_1t + a_2t^2 + \dots + a_nt^n

4. Feature Extraction Using Galois Theory

Calculate roots of  to identify critical points (e.g., peaks, troughs).

Analyze field extensions of  induced by the roots for symmetries.


5. Grothendieck's Sheaf Perspective

Partition the dataset into overlapping subsets.

Fit local polynomials to each subset.

Combine these into a global polynomial using interpolation or averaging.

Python Code

Here's a basic implementation for polynomial fitting and feature extraction:

import numpy as np
import sympy as sp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

# 1. Polynomial fitting function
def fit_polynomial(timestamps, values, degree=3):
    coeffs = np.polyfit(timestamps, values, degree)
    poly = np.poly1d(coeffs)
    return poly, coeffs

# 2. Feature detection (roots, critical points)
def extract_features(poly):
    # Find roots
    roots = sp.solvers.solve(sp.Poly.from_list(poly.coefficients), sp.Symbol('x'))
    
    # Derivative for critical points
    deriv = np.polyder(poly)
    critical_points = sp.solvers.solve(sp.Poly.from_list(deriv.coefficients), sp.Symbol('x'))
    
    return roots, critical_points

# 3. Example dataset
timestamps = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
values = 3 * timestamps**2 - 4 * timestamps + 5 + np.random.normal(0, 10, size=100)

# 4. Fit and visualize
poly, coeffs = fit_polynomial(timestamps, values, degree=2)
roots, critical_points = extract_features(poly)

# Plot
plt.scatter(timestamps, values, label="Data")
plt.plot(timestamps, poly(timestamps), color="red", label="Fitted Polynomial")
plt.legend()
plt.show()

print("Polynomial Coefficients:", coeffs)
print("Roots:", roots)
print("Critical Points:", critical_points)

Extensions and Refinements

1. Higher-Degree Polynomials: Fit higher-degree polynomials to capture more complex features.


2. Local Polynomial Fitting: Partition data and fit smaller polynomials, unifying with Grothendieck's sheaf methodology.


3. Symmetry Analysis: Explore symmetry groups of fitted polynomials to detect periodicity or invariants.

Conclusion

This approach combines Grothendieck’s structural insights and Galois theory’s focus on symmetry to create an elegant, algebraically-grounded framework for polynomial fitting and feature extraction. The Python implementation operationalizes these ideas, making them practical for timestamp-value datasets.
