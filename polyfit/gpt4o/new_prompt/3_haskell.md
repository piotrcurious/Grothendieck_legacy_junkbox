The new polynomial operations include:

1. Basic Operations:
- `polyAdd`: Addition in F2 with proper degree handling
- `leadingTerm`: Extracts leading coefficient and degree
- Improved multiplication with optimized degree tracking

2. Division and GCD:
- `polyDivide`: Long division algorithm for F2 polynomials
- `polyGCD`: Greatest common divisor using Euclidean algorithm
- `polyExtendedGCD`: Extended Euclidean algorithm for Bézout's identity

3. Factorization:
- `factorPoly`: Factors polynomials over F2
- `isIrreducible`: Tests for irreducibility
- `minimalPoly`: Finds minimal polynomial

4. Analysis Tools:
- `analyzePolynomial`: Comprehensive analysis function
- Improved degree computation
- Better handling of zero polynomials

Example usage:

```haskell
-- Create test polynomials
let p1 = F2Poly (V.fromList [One, Zero, One]) 2  -- x^2 + 1
let p2 = F2Poly (V.fromList [One, One]) 1        -- x + 1

-- Division
let PolyDivResult q r = polyDivide p1 p2
putStrLn $ "Quotient: " ++ show q
putStrLn $ "Remainder: " ++ show r

-- GCD computation
let ExtendedGCDResult gcd (s, t) = polyExtendedGCD p1 p2
putStrLn $ "GCD: " ++ show gcd
putStrLn $ "Bézout coefficients: " ++ show (s, t)

-- Factorization analysis
analyzePolynomial p1
```

Would you like me to:
1. Add more specialized polynomial operations (e.g., discrete logarithm)?
2. Implement field extension arithmetic?
3. Add optimization for sparse polynomials?
4. Create specific tools for cryptographic applications?
