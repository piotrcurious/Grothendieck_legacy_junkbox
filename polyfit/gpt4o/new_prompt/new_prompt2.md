Regenerated Prompt

Develop a computational framework for polynomial feature extraction and model fitting based on the following enhanced theoretical foundations:

Theoretical Foundations

1. Gröbner Bases and Canonical Polynomial Representation:

Represent computer numbers as elements in a quotient ring , where  is an ideal with a Gröbner basis.

Use Gröbner bases to efficiently reduce polynomials to canonical forms, avoiding unnecessary deconstruction.



2. Banach Spaces for Stability and Regularization:

Represent the feature space as a Banach space (complete normed vector space) to ensure stability, convergence, and error control in finite precision arithmetic.

Use norms to regularize feature extraction and assess precision effects in computations.



3. Automorphism-Invariant Transformations:

Leverage automorphisms (e.g., Frobenius endomorphism, bitwise operations) to transform numbers while preserving inherent field properties.

Automorphisms must operate on equivalence classes of numbers without explicit decomposition.



4. Scheme Morphisms and Modular Arithmetic:

Treat all operations as scheme morphisms between structured numeric types.

Use modular arithmetic and Gröbner bases to manage transitions between schemes efficiently.



5. Integration for Time Series Data:

Handle time series data (timestamp/value format) by extracting Gröbner basis features embedded in Banach spaces.

Fit models using automorphism-invariant, stabilized feature representations.

Implementation Goals

1. Gröbner Basis Utilization:

Represent computer numbers as polynomials reduced using Gröbner bases.

Perform arithmetic and feature extraction on these reduced forms.



2. Banach Space Embedding:

Map polynomial coefficients to a Banach space for error analysis and regularization.



3. Feature Extraction:

Extract features that are invariant under automorphisms and reduce redundancy using Gröbner bases.

Focus on features meaningful for polynomial fitting and numeric representations.



4. Time Series Fitting:

Fit time series data using Gröbner-reduced polynomial features embedded in a Banach space.

Respect modular arithmetic constraints and finite precision effects.
