To incorporate Gröbner bases and Banach spaces, we will restructure the implementation to leverage their theoretical properties for efficient transformations and feature extraction:

Key Adjustments to the Framework

1. Gröbner Bases for Efficient Polynomial Representation:

Use Gröbner bases to represent polynomials compactly and facilitate operations like modular arithmetic and simplification.

Avoid deconstructing numbers and instead treat them as elements of a polynomial quotient ring, preserving their algebraic properties.



2. Banach Spaces for Stability:

Represent the feature space as a Banach space (complete normed vector space) to ensure convergence of approximations in feature extraction and fitting.

Use the norm to analyze and regularize errors in finite precision and quantization.



3. Operations on Classes of Equivalence:

Transform numbers by applying morphisms to their equivalence classes in the Gröbner basis framework, avoiding direct decomposition.

Enhanced Framework Design

1. Gröbner Basis Representation

Define polynomials as elements of a quotient ring , where  is an ideal with a Gröbner basis.

from sympy import symbols, groebner
from sympy.polys.polytools import Poly

class PolynomialRepresentation:
    def __init__(self, coefficients, modulus=2):
        """
        Initialize a polynomial representation.
        :param coefficients: List of coefficients (binary).
        :param modulus: The modulus for arithmetic (default F2).
        """
        self.coefficients = coefficients
        self.modulus = modulus
        self.x = symbols("x")
        self.poly = Poly(sum(c * self.x**i for i, c in enumerate(coefficients)), modulus=self.modulus)

    def reduce_with_groebner(self, generators):
        """
        Reduce the polynomial using a Gröbner basis.
        :param generators: List of polynomials defining the ideal.
        :return: Reduced polynomial.
        """
        ideal = groebner(generators, self.x, modulus=self.modulus)
        return self.poly.div(ideal[0])[1]  # Remainder after division


---

2. Banach Space Embedding

Represent features in a Banach space with a defined norm to ensure convergence.

import numpy as np

class BanachSpace:
    def __init__(self, dim, norm_type="L2"):
        """
        Initialize a Banach space.
        :param dim: Dimension of the space.
        :param norm_type: Type of norm ("L1", "L2", or "Linf").
        """
        self.dim = dim
        self.norm_type = norm_type

    def norm(self, vector):
        """
        Compute the norm of a vector.
        :param vector: Input vector.
        :return: Norm value.
        """
        if self.norm_type == "L1":
            return np.sum(np.abs(vector))
        elif self.norm_type == "L2":
            return np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(vector)))
        elif self.norm_type == "Linf":
            return np.max(np.abs(vector))
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown norm type: {self.norm_type}")


---

3. Operations Using Gröbner Bases

Perform arithmetic and feature extraction using Gröbner basis reductions.

class SchemeWithGroebner:
    def __init__(self, modulus=2):
        self.modulus = modulus
        self.x = symbols("x")

    def add(self, poly1, poly2):
        """
        Add two polynomials.
        :param poly1: First polynomial (PolynomialRepresentation).
        :param poly2: Second polynomial (PolynomialRepresentation).
        :return: Sum polynomial.
        """
        return PolynomialRepresentation(
            (poly1.poly + poly2.poly).all_coeffs(), modulus=self.modulus
        )

    def multiply(self, poly1, poly2, groebner_basis):
        """
        Multiply two polynomials with Gröbner basis reduction.
        :param poly1: First polynomial (PolynomialRepresentation).
        :param poly2: Second polynomial (PolynomialRepresentation).
        :param groebner_basis: Gröbner basis for the ideal.
        :return: Product polynomial reduced modulo the Gröbner basis.
        """
        product = poly1.poly * poly2.poly
        reduced_poly = PolynomialRepresentation([], modulus=self.modulus)
        reduced_poly.poly = product.div(groebner_basis[0])[1]  # Remainder
        return reduced_poly


---

4. Automorphism-Invariant Feature Extraction

Features are now Gröbner basis invariants embedded in a Banach space.

def extract_features_with_banach(poly, groebner_basis, banach_space):
    """
    Extract features using Gröbner basis and embed in a Banach space.
    :param poly: Polynomial representation.
    :param groebner_basis: Gröbner basis for the ideal.
    :param banach_space: Banach space for embedding.
    :return: Feature vector.
    """
    reduced_poly = poly.reduce_with_groebner(groebner_basis)
    coefficients = reduced_poly.all_coeffs()
    return np.array(coefficients[:banach_space.dim])  # Truncate/pad to fit dimension


---

5. Fitting Using Banach Spaces

Fit a time series using the normed space.

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

def fit_with_banach(timestamps, values, groebner_basis, banach_space, max_degree=64):
    """
    Fit a model using Gröbner basis features and a Banach space.
    :param timestamps: List of timestamps.
    :param values: List of values.
    :param groebner_basis: Gröbner basis for polynomial reduction.
    :param banach_space: Banach space for feature embedding.
    :param max_degree: Maximum polynomial degree.
    :return: Fitted model.
    """
    polys = [PolynomialRepresentation(val, modulus=2) for val in values]
    features = [
        extract_features_with_banach(poly, groebner_basis, banach_space) for poly in polys
    ]

    X = np.array(features)
    y = np.array(timestamps)

    # Fit linear regression in Banach space
    model = LinearRegression()
    model.fit(X, y)
    return model

Theoretical Advancements

1. Gröbner Basis Efficiency:
Operations use canonical forms, reducing redundancies and ensuring consistency. This avoids the repeated low-level deconstruction of polynomials.


2. Banach Space Regularization:
Embedding features in a Banach space ensures stability and convergence during fitting and transformations, accounting for finite precision and quantization effects.


3. Automorphism-Invariance:
Features are naturally invariant under automorphisms, as Gröbner basis reduction eliminates extraneous degrees of freedom.


4. Scalability:
Modular arithmetic and Gröbner bases make the framework scalable for both integers and floating-point numbers.
