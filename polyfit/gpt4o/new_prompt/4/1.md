Key theoretical improvements:

1. Scheme Theory Foundation:
- Properly implemented scheme structure with coordinate rings and structure sheaves
- Added support for prime spectrum and ideals
- Implemented proper scheme morphisms with pullback and pushforward maps

2. Field Structure:
- Added typeclass for field operations
- Proper handling of F2 as the base field
- Maintained field structure through all operations

3. Local Structure:
- Added support for local rings and gluing conditions
- Proper handling of scheme-theoretic local data
- Compatibility checks for operations

4. Morphisms:
- Enhanced scheme morphisms with proper category-theoretic structure
- Added verification of morphism compatibility
- Proper handling of pullback and pushforward maps

5. Feature Extraction:
- Now properly preserves scheme structure
- Handles local data correctly
- Maintains compatibility conditions

Would you like me to:
1. Add more sophisticated scheme-theoretic operations (e.g., fiber products)?
2. Implement Ã©tale morphisms and covers?
3. Add support for more general base schemes?
4. Enhance the model fitting with better scheme-theoretic guarantees?

The framework now properly respects the underlying algebraic geometry, ensuring that all operations are theoretically sound and preserve the required structures.
