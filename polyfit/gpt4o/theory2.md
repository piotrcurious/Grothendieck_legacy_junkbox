Incorporating the field nature of numbers into polynomial fitting and function feature extraction deepens the connection to Galois and Grothendieck's work. Viewing numbers themselves as polynomials, rather than isolated entities, simplifies the process by providing a unified framework for operations and relationships. This also reveals the inherent elegance of Grothendieck's work, where abstraction and interconnectedness shine.

1. Numbers as Polynomials

Every number  in a field  can be interpreted as the constant polynomial , or, more generally, as the root of a higher-degree polynomial:

Rational numbers : Roots of linear polynomials .

Algebraic numbers: Roots of polynomials with integer coefficients.

Real and complex numbers: Part of extended fields, often seen as roots of polynomials over  or .


By treating numbers as polynomials, every data point in polynomial fitting becomes part of a richer algebraic structure. For example:



 This representation ensures that the relationships between numbers (e.g., symmetries, invariants) are preserved.

2. Field Structures Simplify Polynomial Fitting

Polynomials form a ring (or a field if irreducible), where addition, multiplication, and division (if invertible) are well-defined. This field-like behavior simplifies polynomial fitting:

Addition and Multiplication: Combine polynomials naturally during interpolation or regression.

Division: Handle inverses, enabling operations like rational function fitting.

Root Relationships: Galois groups capture the symmetry of roots within the field, guiding constraints on polynomial fitting.


By recognizing that the dataset itself is an extension of a field, operations in polynomial fitting align with field properties. For example:

Lagrange interpolation uses addition and multiplication in the field.

Least-squares fitting minimizes errors using field norms.


Example

Given data points :

1. Interpret each  as elements of a field .


2. Use field operations to construct the fitting polynomial , ensuring consistency with the field's structure.

3. Feature Extraction in the Context of Fields

Function feature extraction benefits from field-based reasoning by linking the function and its derivatives to field invariants:

Critical Points and Roots: Critical points  are roots of a polynomial derived from . In a field, their relationships (e.g., conjugacy) are captured by the Galois group.

Inflection Points and Symmetry: Inflection points (where ) reflect deeper field symmetries, offering insights into curvature and higher-order behavior.


Grothendieck’s Contribution

Grothendieck viewed geometric objects and their features as interconnected via morphisms in a category. When numbers are treated as polynomials:

1. Features are Morphisms: Critical points, inflection points, and roots map onto features via derivatives and other operations.


2. Unified Perspective: The function and its features exist as objects in a single algebraic category, simplifying computations and highlighting relationships.

4. Demonstrating Grothendieck's Elegance

Grothendieck's work emphasizes abstraction and generality. By treating numbers, polynomials, and features as interconnected objects:

Abstraction: Numbers as polynomials unify discrete data points and continuous functions.

Elegance: Polynomial fitting and feature extraction reduce to operations in a single algebraic category.

Simplicity: Field properties naturally guide fitting and feature extraction, eliminating the need for arbitrary rules or separate structures.


For instance, Grothendieck’s idea of a scheme allows us to generalize the concept of "data points" as solutions to polynomials, turning fitting into a geometric operation.

5. Practical Implications

This framework provides:

1. Simplified Fitting: Polynomial fitting becomes a natural algebraic process using field operations.


2. Elegant Feature Extraction: Features like roots, critical points, and inflection points align with field invariants.


3. Robust Models: Galois symmetries ensure that models respect data invariants, while Grothendieck’s abstraction organizes relationships.



Example Workflow

1. Define the dataset as elements of a field .


2. Construct the fitting polynomial  using field operations.


3. Extract features (e.g., roots, critical points) by finding invariants under Galois symmetries.


4. Use Grothendieck’s abstraction to understand how features relate globally.

Conclusion

Treating every number as a polynomial rooted in a field simplifies polynomial fitting and feature extraction by embedding these processes in a rich algebraic structure. Grothendieck’s work highlights the elegance of this approach, where numbers, functions, and features are unified through abstraction and interconnectedness. This not only simplifies computations but also reveals the inherent beauty of mathematics.
