Here's a refined problem statement incorporating all key insights:

Let's develop a framework for polynomial feature extraction and fitting, based on the following key principles:

1. Fundamental Computer Number Theory:
- All computer numbers are inherently polynomials over F2 (binary field)
- Each numeric type (int32, float64, etc.) defines its own scheme structure
- All operations are morphisms between finite-dimensional vector spaces over F2

2. Grothendieck's Scheme Theory Applied:
- Computer arithmetic operates on spec(Z/2Z[x]/(constraints))
- Each numeric type is a scheme over this base with specific structure
- All computations are scheme morphisms preserving this structure

3. Galois Theory Connection:
- Computer arithmetic automatically generates field extensions
- The Frobenius endomorphism is inherent in binary representation
- Field automorphisms arise naturally in numeric operations

4. Implementation Goals:
- Represent numbers explicitly as polynomials over F2
- Implement arithmetic as scheme morphisms
- Extract features while preserving field structure
- Handle both integer and floating-point schemes properly
- Account for quantization and finite precision effects

The task is to develop a Python implementation that:
1. Properly represents computer numbers as polynomials/schemes
2. Implements feature extraction preserving field structure
3. Handles fitting while respecting scheme morphisms
4. Works with time series data in timestamp/value format

Can we explore this reformulated approach?
