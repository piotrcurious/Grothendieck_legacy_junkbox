Continuing from where we left off, let's refine and expand the Tanks game implementation by adding collision detection, scorekeeping, UI enhancements, and multi-turn gameplay.


---

Enhancements

1. Collision Detection:

Check if the projectile's position overlaps with a tank's position.



2. Scorekeeping:

Maintain scores for both players and display them on the screen.



3. UI Enhancements:

Show player angles, power, and scores on the TFT display.



4. Multi-Turn Gameplay:

Alternate between players until one reaches a defined score or a specific number of rounds is completed.

Collision Detection

bool checkCollision(const Player& tank, int x, int y) {
    return (x >= tank.x && x <= (tank.x + TANK_WIDTH) &&
            y >= tank.y && y <= (tank.y + TANK_HEIGHT));
}

Integrate this into the drawProjectile function:

bool drawProjectile(Player& player, Player& opponent, const std::vector<int>& terrain) {
    float radianAngle = player.angle * M_PI / 180.0;
    float velocityX = player.power * cos(radianAngle);
    float velocityY = -player.power * sin(radianAngle);

    Polynomial xPoly({player.x, velocityX}, SCREEN_WIDTH);
    Polynomial yPoly({player.y, velocityY, GRAVITY}, SCREEN_HEIGHT);

    for (int t = 0; t < SCREEN_WIDTH; t++) {
        int posX = xPoly.coefficients[0] + xPoly.coefficients[1] * t;
        int posY = yPoly.coefficients[0] + yPoly.coefficients[1] * t + yPoly.coefficients[2] * t * t;

        if (posX < 0 || posX >= SCREEN_WIDTH || posY >= SCREEN_HEIGHT) break;

        // Stop if the projectile hits the ground
        if (posY >= terrain[posX]) break;

        // Check for collision with the opponent's tank
        if (checkCollision(opponent, posX, posY)) {
            tft.fillCircle(posX, posY, 3, RED); // Explosion effect
            return true; // Hit detected
        }

        tft.drawPixel(posX, posY, WHITE);
        delay(10);
    }
    return false; // No hit
}

Scorekeeping

Add a score system:

int scorePlayer1 = 0;
int scorePlayer2 = 0;

void updateScore(int player) {
    if (player == 1) scorePlayer1++;
    else scorePlayer2++;

    // Display updated scores
    tft.setTextColor(WHITE, BLACK);
    tft.setCursor(10, 10);
    tft.print("P1: ");
    tft.print(scorePlayer1);
    tft.setCursor(SCREEN_WIDTH - 60, 10);
    tft.print("P2: ");
    tft.print(scorePlayer2);
}


---

UI Enhancements

Display player status:

void displayPlayerStatus(const Player& player, int x, int y, uint16_t color) {
    tft.setTextColor(color, BLACK);
    tft.setCursor(x, y);
    tft.print("Angle: ");
    tft.print(player.angle);
    tft.setCursor(x, y + 10);
    tft.print("Power: ");
    tft.print(player.power);
}

Call displayPlayerStatus during the game loop to show current player stats.


---

Multi-Turn Gameplay

void gameLoop(std::vector<int>& terrain) {
    int currentPlayer = 1;

    while (scorePlayer1 < 5 && scorePlayer2 < 5) { // Play until a score of 5
        Player& activePlayer = (currentPlayer == 1) ? player1 : player2;
        Player& opponent = (currentPlayer == 1) ? player2 : player1;

        // Display player stats
        displayPlayerStatus(activePlayer, 10, 30, (currentPlayer == 1) ? BLUE : RED);

        // Fire projectile
        bool hit = drawProjectile(activePlayer, opponent, terrain);
        if (hit) {
            updateScore(currentPlayer);
        }

        // Alternate players
        currentPlayer = (currentPlayer == 1) ? 2 : 1;

        delay(1000); // Pause between turns
    }

    // Display winner
    tft.fillScreen(BLACK);
    tft.setTextColor(WHITE);
    tft.setCursor(SCREEN_WIDTH / 2 - 50, SCREEN_HEIGHT / 2);
    if (scorePlayer1 > scorePlayer2) {
        tft.print("Player 1 Wins!");
    } else {
        tft.print("Player 2 Wins!");
    }
}

Full Game Example

void setup() {
    tft.begin();
    tft.setRotation(1);
    tft.fillScreen(BLACK);

    // Generate and draw terrain
    std::vector<int> terrain = generateTerrain();
    drawTerrain(terrain);

    // Draw tanks
    drawTank(player1, BLUE);
    drawTank(player2, RED);

    // Display initial scores
    updateScore(0); // Initialize score display

    // Start game loop
    gameLoop(terrain);
}

void loop() {
    // No need for code here; game runs in `setup`.
}

Further Enhancements

1. Explosion Animation:

Add a small animation when a projectile hits a tank or terrain.



2. Customizable Rounds:

Allow players to choose the number of rounds before starting.



3. Wind Effect:

Introduce a random wind factor to affect the projectile's trajectory.



4. Obstacle Generation:

Place random obstacles on the terrain to increase difficulty.



5. AI Opponent:

Implement basic AI for single-player gameplay.
