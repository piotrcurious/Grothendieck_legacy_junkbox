To better integrate the AlgebraicCompute library and showcase its utility, we can enhance the game logic and mechanics to rely more heavily on polynomial-based computations and Gröbner basis reductions. This ensures the game not only demonstrates gameplay but also highlights the computational capabilities provided by the library.

Areas of Integration

1. Projectile Trajectory Calculation:

Represent projectiles entirely as polynomials and apply Gröbner basis reductions to simplify and analyze their motion.



2. Wind Factor Integration:

Treat wind as a dynamic polynomial term, making trajectory adjustments dependent on polynomial arithmetic.



3. Explosion Radius and Terrain Damage:

Model the explosion radius and terrain damage using algebraic constructs, including multivariate polynomials.



4. AI Interception:

Utilize polynomial intersections to calculate AI turret trajectories for intercepting projectiles.

Enhanced Implementation

1. Projectile Trajectory

Instead of manually computing positions, represent the entire trajectory as a Gröbner-reduced polynomial:

Polynomial computeTrajectory(const Player& player, float windFactor) {
    float radianAngle = player.angle * M_PI / 180.0;
    Polynomial xPoly({player.x, player.power * cos(radianAngle) + windFactor}, SCREEN_WIDTH);
    Polynomial yPoly({player.y, -player.power * sin(radianAngle), GRAVITY}, SCREEN_HEIGHT);

    return xPoly * yPoly; // Combine for trajectory representation
}

bool checkProjectileCollision(const Polynomial& trajectory, const Player& opponent, int t) {
    int posX = trajectory.coefficients[0] + trajectory.coefficients[1] * t;
    int posY = trajectory.coefficients[2] * t * t;

    return checkCollision(opponent, posX, posY);
}

2. Wind Factor as a Polynomial

Represent wind as a dynamic term in the polynomial:

Polynomial windEffect = Polynomial({0, windFactor}, SCREEN_WIDTH); // Dynamic polynomial for wind

void updateWindPolynomial() {
    windFactor = (rand() % 21 - 10) / 10.0;
    windEffect.coefficients[1] = windFactor; // Update the wind term
    tft.setCursor(SCREEN_WIDTH / 2 - 40, 10);
    tft.print("Wind: ");
    tft.print(windFactor);
}

Integrate this into the trajectory computation:

Polynomial adjustedTrajectory = computeTrajectory(player, windFactor);

3. Explosion and Terrain Damage

Model the explosion as a circular region using algebraic representations. The damage function depends on the explosion radius and polynomial operations:

Polynomial explosionDamage(int centerX, int radius) {
    // Polynomial representation of the explosion radius
    return Polynomial({centerX, -radius, radius});
}

void applyExplosionDamage(std::vector<int>& terrain, int centerX, int radius) {
    Polynomial damage = explosionDamage(centerX, radius);
    for (int x = max(0, centerX - radius); x < min(SCREEN_WIDTH, centerX + radius); x++) {
        int dist = abs(damage.coefficients[0] - x);
        if (dist <= radius) {
            terrain[x] += radius - dist; // Damage terrain downward
        }
    }
}


---

4. AI Interception via Polynomial Intersections

The AI turret uses Gröbner basis to determine intersection points between its projectile and the incoming one:

bool fireInterceptor(const Polynomial& incomingTrajectory, Turret& turret, std::vector<int>& terrain) {
    float velocity = 20;
    float angle = atan2(incomingTrajectory.coefficients[2], incomingTrajectory.coefficients[1]);
    Polynomial aiTrajectory({turret.x, velocity * cos(angle)}, SCREEN_WIDTH);

    Polynomial intersection = incomingTrajectory - aiTrajectory; // Solve for intersections

    // Reduce using Gröbner basis to find roots (points of interception)
    GröbnerBasis basis = reduceToGroebnerBasis(intersection);

    for (int t = 0; t < SCREEN_WIDTH; t++) {
        int posX = basis.evaluate(t).coefficients[0];
        int posY = basis.evaluate(t).coefficients[1];

        if (posX < 0 || posX >= SCREEN_WIDTH || posY >= SCREEN_HEIGHT) break;
        if (posY >= terrain[posX]) break;

        if (posX == incomingTrajectory.evaluate(t).coefficients[0] &&
            posY == incomingTrajectory.evaluate(t).coefficients[2]) {
            drawExplosion(posX, posY, 5);
            return true; // Successfully intercepted
        }
    }
    return false;
}

5. Enhanced Game Loop

The game loop now fully utilizes the AlgebraicCompute library for trajectory calculations, wind adjustments, explosion modeling, and AI interception:

void gameLoop(std::vector<int>& terrain) {
    int currentPlayer = 1;

    while (scorePlayer1 < 5 && scorePlayer2 < 5) {
        updateWindPolynomial(); // Update wind at the start of each turn

        Player& activePlayer = (currentPlayer == 1) ? player1 : player2;
        Player& opponent = (currentPlayer == 1) ? player2 : player1;

        drawTurret(aiTurret); // Draw AI turret

        // Compute trajectory
        Polynomial trajectory = computeTrajectory(activePlayer, windFactor);

        // Check for collisions and apply explosion damage
        bool hit = false;
        for (int t = 0; t < SCREEN_WIDTH; t++) {
            if (checkProjectileCollision(trajectory, opponent, t)) {
                drawExplosion(trajectory.evaluate(t).coefficients[0], terrain[trajectory.evaluate(t).coefficients[0]], MAX_EXPLOSION_RADIUS);
                applyExplosionDamage(terrain, trajectory.evaluate(t).coefficients[0], MAX_EXPLOSION_RADIUS);
                hit = true;
                break;
            }
        }

        // AI attempts to intercept
        if (aiInterception(trajectory, terrain)) {
            tft.setCursor(10, 50);
            tft.print("Interceptor fired!");
        }

        if (hit) {
            updateScore(currentPlayer);
        }

        // Alternate players
        currentPlayer = (currentPlayer == 1) ? 2 : 1;
        delay(1000);
    }
}
