To create the corresponding decompression function, we'll take the compressed data represented by the polynomial coefficients and reconstruct the original data (or approximate it based on the polynomial model). The decompression process involves evaluating the polynomial using the precomputed coefficients over the window of data.

Decompression Function Implementation

The function will loop over each window of the compressed data, apply the polynomial coefficients to generate the predicted data points, and then combine those points to recreate the original dataset.

Hereâ€™s how the decompression function can be implemented:

// Decompression function that reconstructs data from the compressed polynomial coefficients
void decompressData(int *x, float *decompressedData, Candidate candidate, int windowStart, int windowSize) {
    int degree = candidate.degree;

    for (int i = 0; i < windowSize; i++) {
        decompressedData[i + windowStart] = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j <= degree; j++) {
            decompressedData[i + windowStart] += candidate.coefficients[j] * pow(x[i], j);  // Polynomial evaluation
        }
    }
}

void performDecompression() {
    // Define decompressed data array
    float decompressedData[10]; // Adjust size as needed based on your data

    // Define the x-axis values corresponding to the data (could be time points or index)
    int x[10] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};

    // Example compressed data (select one of the candidates after the evolutionary algorithm)
    Candidate bestCandidate = candidates[population[0].candidateIndex];

    // Decompress data for a given window
    int windowStart = 0;
    decompressData(x, decompressedData, bestCandidate, windowStart, bestCandidate.windowSize);

    // Output the decompressed data for verification
    Serial.println("Decompressed Data:");
    for (int i = windowStart; i < windowStart + bestCandidate.windowSize; i++) {
        Serial.print("x[");
        Serial.print(x[i]);
        Serial.print("] = ");
        Serial.println(decompressedData[i]);
    }
}

void loop() {
    // Perform decompression in the main loop after running evolutionary algorithm
    performDecompression();
}

Explanation:

1. decompressData Function:

It takes the x-values (x), an empty array for decompressedData, the selected candidate (from the evolutionary algorithm), and window-specific parameters (windowStart, windowSize).

For each point in the window, it evaluates the polynomial at the given x-value using the precomputed coefficients from the candidate polynomial, generating the decompressed y-values (sensor readings).



2. Polynomial Evaluation:

The polynomial is evaluated using the formula:




\text{predicted\_value} = \sum_{j=0}^{\text{degree}} \text{coefficients}[j] \times (\text{x}[i])^j

3. Integration with Evolutionary Algorithm:

After running the evolutionary algorithm, we select the best candidate (i.e., bestCandidate) and pass its polynomial coefficients to the decompressData function to reconstruct the data.



4. Output:

The reconstructed (or decompressed) data is stored in the decompressedData array and printed to the serial monitor for verification.




Key Considerations:

Decompression Quality: The decompressed data is an approximation of the original data, depending on how well the polynomial fits the data within the specified window size and degree.

Window Management: If the data is divided into multiple windows during compression, you can loop over each window and call decompressData multiple times, adjusting the windowStart and windowSize for each call.

Memory: Be mindful of the memory usage on an Arduino. If the dataset is large, you might need to process the data in smaller chunks.


With this, the compressed data is decompressed based on the candidate polynomial function selected during the evolutionary process. This decompression routine allows you to reconstruct the sensor data using minimal storage space and retrieve it efficiently on the Arduino.
