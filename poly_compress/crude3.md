To align with your approach, where JuMP is used to precompute function candidate tables outside the Arduino environment and then apply evolutionary algorithms within Arduino, we will:

1. Precompute Function Candidates with JuMP:

JuMP will be used to generate a set of polynomial function candidates based on different window sizes and degrees. This step occurs on a development machine (e.g., using Julia).

The candidates are optimized based on a mix of data compression ratio and reconstruction error.



2. Preload Optimized Candidates on Arduino:

The precomputed candidates are transferred to the Arduino in the form of tables (coefficients and associated metadata).

The Arduino will select the best candidate during runtime using evolutionary algorithms.



3. Advanced Evolutionary Algorithm on Arduino:

The Arduino runs an evolutionary algorithm, using the precomputed candidate tables to adaptively select the most efficient compression scheme based on the incoming data.




Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. Precomputing Function Candidates with JuMP:

JuMP will generate polynomial fit coefficients for a range of window sizes and polynomial degrees.

These results will be stored in a JSON file or a similar format that can be loaded into Arduino as tables of coefficients.



2. Using Evolutionary Algorithm on Arduino:

Once the function candidates are available, the Arduino will use an evolutionary strategy to determine which candidate to apply based on the current data stream.




Precomputing Candidate Functions with JuMP (Julia Example)

This Julia script using JuMP will generate polynomial fits for various window sizes and polynomial degrees, saving them to a file.

using JuMP, Ipopt, JSON

function generate_polynomial_candidates(x_data, y_data, window_sizes, degrees)
    candidates = []
    
    for window_size in window_sizes
        for degree in degrees
            model = Model(Ipopt.Optimizer)
            @variable(model, coeff[1:degree+1])
            @objective(model, Min, sum((y_data[i] - sum(coeff[j] * x_data[i]^(j-1) for j in 1:degree+1))^2 for i in 1:window_size))
            
            optimize!(model)
            
            # Extract optimized coefficients
            coeff_values = value.(coeff)
            push!(candidates, Dict(
                "window_size" => window_size,
                "degree" => degree,
                "coefficients" => coeff_values
            ))
        end
    end

    return candidates
end

# Sample data
x_data = 1:10
y_data = [1.0, 2.1, 2.9, 4.1, 5.0, 5.9, 6.8, 7.9, 8.9, 9.8]

# Range of window sizes and degrees to consider
window_sizes = [5, 7, 9]
degrees = [1, 2, 3]

# Generate and save candidates
candidates = generate_polynomial_candidates(x_data, y_data, window_sizes, degrees)
open("polynomial_candidates.json", "w") do file
    write(file, JSON.json(candidates))
end

This will produce a file polynomial_candidates.json containing all candidate functions' coefficients. For each candidate, the window size, polynomial degree, and the corresponding coefficients are stored.

Loading Precomputed Candidates into Arduino

Once the JSON file has been generated, it can be converted to a C array format or similar, which can be embedded in the Arduino program.

Hereâ€™s an example of how the JSON data might look once converted:

[
    {
        "window_size": 5,
        "degree": 2,
        "coefficients": [1.2, 0.5, 0.02]
    },
    {
        "window_size": 7,
        "degree": 3,
        "coefficients": [0.8, 0.4, 0.1, -0.03]
    }
]

Arduino Implementation with Evolutionary Algorithm

On the Arduino side, we will:

1. Load the Candidate Tables.


2. Run the Evolutionary Algorithm to dynamically select the best-fitting candidate based on the incoming data stream.



#include <Arduino.h>
#include <math.h>

#define POPULATION_SIZE 5  // Number of candidates
#define MAX_GENERATIONS 10  // Number of iterations

// Candidate table generated from precomputed JuMP results
struct Candidate {
  int windowSize;
  int degree;
  float coefficients[4];  // Max degree 3 supported in this example
};

Candidate candidates[POPULATION_SIZE] = {
  {5, 2, {1.2, 0.5, 0.02}},
  {7, 3, {0.8, 0.4, 0.1, -0.03}},
  // Add more candidates here...
};

// Data arrays
int x[10];         // X (time or sample points)
int y[10];         // Y (sensor readings)

// Chromosome for evolutionary algorithm
struct Chromosome {
  int candidateIndex;  // Index in candidate table
  float fitness;       // Fitness score
};

Chromosome population[POPULATION_SIZE];  // Population for evolution

// Fitness calculation based on reconstruction error
float calculateFitness(int* x, int* y, Candidate candidate);

// Evolutionary algorithm: Select the best candidate for current data
void runEvolutionaryAlgorithm();

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);

  // Example sensor data collection
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    x[i] = i;
    y[i] = analogRead(A0);  // Example sensor data
    delay(100);
  }

  // Run the evolutionary algorithm to select the best candidate
  runEvolutionaryAlgorithm();
}

void loop() {
  // Continuously collect data and adjust candidate selection
}

// Evaluate fitness of a candidate using polynomial fitting
float calculateFitness(int* x, int* y, Candidate candidate) {
  int windowSize = candidate.windowSize;
  int degree = candidate.degree;
  float mse = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < windowSize; i++) {
    float predicted = 0;
    for (int j = 0; j <= degree; j++) {
      predicted += candidate.coefficients[j] * pow(x[i], j);
    }
    mse += pow(predicted - y[i], 2);
  }

  mse /= windowSize;

  // Fitness is inverse of mean squared error
  return 1.0 / (mse + 1e-6);  // Avoid division by zero
}

// Run an evolutionary algorithm to select the best candidate
void runEvolutionaryAlgorithm() {
  // Initialize population with random candidates
  for (int i = 0; i < POPULATION_SIZE; i++) {
    population[i].candidateIndex = i;
    population[i].fitness = calculateFitness(x, y, candidates[i]);
  }

  // Evolve the population over generations
  for (int gen = 0; gen < MAX_GENERATIONS; gen++) {
    // Select the best candidate based on fitness
    float bestFitness = -1;
    int bestIndex = -1;

    for (int i = 0; i < POPULATION_SIZE; i++) {
      if (population[i].fitness > bestFitness) {
        bestFitness = population[i].fitness;
        bestIndex = population[i].candidateIndex;
      }
    }

    // Output the best candidate
    Serial.print("Best candidate: Window size ");
    Serial.print(candidates[bestIndex].windowSize);
    Serial.print(", Degree ");
    Serial.println(candidates[bestIndex].degree);
  }
}

Summary of the Improvements:

1. JuMP is used offline to generate a wide range of precomputed polynomial functions, optimizing for different window sizes and polynomial degrees.


2. Precomputed data is loaded onto the Arduino, which uses an evolutionary algorithm to select the best candidate at runtime based on real-time data.


3. Efficiency is achieved by abstracting optimization outside the microcontroller and offloading it to a more powerful machine while keeping runtime decision-making lightweight on Arduino.
