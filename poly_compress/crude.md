To improve the rolling buffer example by implementing data compression using least squares polynomial matching, we can compress the buffer data by fitting a polynomial to a window of data points. Instead of storing every data point, we store the polynomial coefficients. This reduces the number of values needed to represent the data, while still allowing us to reconstruct it with reasonable accuracy.

Step 1: Least Squares Polynomial Fitting

The least squares method finds a polynomial that minimizes the error between the actual data points and the values predicted by the polynomial. The polynomial fitting problem can be solved with a matrix approach, and you can implement this directly on Arduino (or a separate computation platform like Julia or Python for complex computations).

Step 2: Arduino Code for Least Squares Polynomial Fitting

Here is a basic implementation of how you could compress the data using least squares polynomial fitting on a sliding window in an Arduino sketch:

1. Polynomial Fitting Function

#include <Arduino.h>

// Perform least squares polynomial fitting (degree 2) on a set of data points
void polynomialFit(int* x, int* y, int n, float* coeffs) {
  float Sx = 0, Sy = 0, Sxx = 0, Sxy = 0, Sxxx = 0, Sxxxy = 0, Sxxxx = 0;

  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    Sx += x[i];
    Sy += y[i];
    Sxx += x[i] * x[i];
    Sxy += x[i] * y[i];
    Sxxx += x[i] * x[i] * x[i];
    Sxxxy += x[i] * x[i] * y[i];
    Sxxxx += x[i] * x[i] * x[i] * x[i];
  }

  float det = n * (Sxx * Sxxxx - Sxxx * Sxxx) - Sx * (Sx * Sxxxx - Sxxx * Sxx) + Sxx * (Sx * Sxxx - Sxx * Sxx);
  coeffs[0] = (Sy * (Sxx * Sxxxx - Sxxx * Sxxx) - Sxy * (Sx * Sxxxx - Sxxx * Sxx) + Sxxxy * (Sx * Sxxx - Sxx * Sxx)) / det;
  coeffs[1] = (n * (Sxy * Sxxxx - Sxxx * Sxxxy) - Sy * (Sx * Sxxxx - Sxxx * Sxx) + Sxx * (Sx * Sxxxy - Sxx * Sxy)) / det;
  coeffs[2] = (n * (Sxx * Sxxxy - Sxy * Sxxx) - Sx * (Sy * Sxxx - Sxx * Sxxxy) + Sy * (Sx * Sxy - Sxx * Sy)) / det;
}

2. Optimizing and Compressing the Buffer

Next, instead of storing all the data points in the buffer, you store polynomial coefficients that approximate these data points for each window of time.

// Rolling buffer structure
struct RollingBuffer {
  float* buffer;  // Buffer to store polynomial coefficients
  int bufferSize; // Number of windows stored
  int windowSize; // Number of data points in each window
  int index;      // Current buffer index
};

// Initialize the rolling buffer for polynomial coefficients
void initBuffer(RollingBuffer* buf, int bufferSize, int windowSize) {
  buf->buffer = new float[bufferSize * 3];  // Each window stores 3 polynomial coefficients (degree 2)
  buf->bufferSize = bufferSize;
  buf->windowSize = windowSize;
  buf->index = 0;
}

// Add polynomial coefficients to the rolling buffer (data compression)
void addToBuffer(RollingBuffer* buf, float* coeffs) {
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    buf->buffer[buf->index * 3 + i] = coeffs[i];
  }
  buf->index = (buf->index + 1) % buf->bufferSize;
}

3. Arduino Loop to Gather Data and Apply Compression

In this loop, the sensor data is collected in batches (or windows), and a polynomial fit is applied to compress the data before adding it to the rolling buffer.

#define BUFFER_SIZE 10   // Number of windows to store
#define WINDOW_SIZE 5    // Number of data points per window

RollingBuffer buffer;
int x[WINDOW_SIZE];      // Time indices for the data points
int y[WINDOW_SIZE];      // Data points (e.g., sensor readings)
float coeffs[3];         // Polynomial coefficients

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  initBuffer(&buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, WINDOW_SIZE);
}

void loop() {
  // Collect data in batches (simulate data collection from sensor)
  for (int i = 0; i < WINDOW_SIZE; i++) {
    x[i] = i;  // Simulating time or index
    y[i] = analogRead(A0);  // Example sensor data
    delay(100);  // Simulate sampling delay
  }

  // Apply polynomial fitting to compress data
  polynomialFit(x, y, WINDOW_SIZE, coeffs);

  // Add the compressed polynomial coefficients to the rolling buffer
  addToBuffer(&buffer, coeffs);

  // Debug output to show the coefficients stored
  Serial.print("Stored Coefficients: ");
  for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    Serial.print(coeffs[i]);
    Serial.print(" ");
  }
  Serial.println();

  delay(1000);  // Pause before next data collection
}

Step 3: Reconstructing Data from the Polynomial

If you want to reconstruct the data from the polynomial coefficients, you can evaluate the polynomial for any given index x:

// Reconstruct the data point for a given x using the polynomial coefficients
float reconstructData(float* coeffs, int x) {
  return coeffs[0] + coeffs[1] * x + coeffs[2] * x * x;
}

Step 4: Analyzing and Optimizing with JuMP

You could use JuMP in Julia to further optimize the window size or the degree of the polynomial used in fitting. This might involve optimizing the tradeoff between data compression (smaller polynomial degree or fewer windows) and the accuracy of data reconstruction.

Hereâ€™s how you could define this in JuMP:

using JuMP, GLPK

# Define data points (as an example)
data_points = [10, 12, 15, 14, 13]

# Set up the JuMP model to optimize window size and degree of polynomial
model = Model(GLPK.Optimizer)

# Decision variable: the degree of the polynomial (could be 1, 2, or 3)
@variable(model, degree >= 1, Int)

# Decision variable: window size (number of points to fit the polynomial)
@variable(model, window_size >= 3, Int)

# Objective: minimize window size for data compression, balanced with the degree of polynomial
@objective(model, Min, window_size + degree)

# Add constraints based on the data fitting accuracy or memory requirements
@constraint(model, window_size <= 10)  # Example constraint

# Optimize the model
optimize!(model)

# Get the optimized window size and degree of the polynomial
optimal_window_size = value(window_size)
optimal_degree = value(degree)

println("Optimal window size: $optimal_window_size, Optimal polynomial degree: $optimal_degree")

Conclusion

This approach integrates least squares polynomial fitting with rolling buffer data compression on Arduino. By fitting a polynomial to a sliding window of data points, the rolling buffer stores polynomial coefficients instead of raw data, reducing memory usage. You can further refine the compression and performance by leveraging JuMP to optimize parameters like window size and polynomial degree.
