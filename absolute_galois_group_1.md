The Absolute Galois group is a concept from field theory and algebraic geometry, often used in number theory and related fields. Its application in compression algorithms, particularly through cohomology operations, is quite advanced and not commonly found in typical compression methods. However, the theoretical underpinnings can be applied in niche or research-focused implementations.

### Theoretical Background

**Absolute Galois Group:**
The Absolute Galois group \( Gal(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q}) \) is the group of all field automorphisms of the algebraic closure of the rational numbers \(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}\) that fix \(\mathbb{Q}\). This group captures symmetries of algebraic equations and can be linked to various advanced mathematical structures.

**Cohomology in Group Theory:**
Cohomology groups, especially in the context of Galois cohomology, provide tools for classifying and understanding extensions and relations within field extensions. They are used to study the properties of fields and their automorphism groups.

### Application in Compression Algorithms

Using the Absolute Galois group and cohomology operations in compression is highly theoretical and might involve advanced algebraic data structures. The general idea would be to use these algebraic structures to identify and exploit symmetries or patterns in the data that typical compression algorithms might miss.

### Example: Simplified Illustrative C++ Code

Below is a highly simplified example to illustrate the concept. The example does not directly use the Absolute Galois group but demonstrates a basic compression technique involving group theory concepts.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

// Function to perform a simple run-length encoding (RLE) compression
std::vector<std::pair<char, int>> compress(const std::string& data) {
    std::vector<std::pair<char, int>> compressed;
    int n = data.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int count = 1;
        while (i < n - 1 && data[i] == data[i + 1]) {
            ++i;
            ++count;
        }
        compressed.push_back({data[i], count});
    }
    return compressed;
}

// Function to decompress the run-length encoded data
std::string decompress(const std::vector<std::pair<char, int>>& compressed) {
    std::string decompressed;
    for (const auto& p : compressed) {
        decompressed.append(p.second, p.first);
    }
    return decompressed;
}

int main() {
    std::string data = "aaabbbcccaaa";
    auto compressed = compress(data);

    std::cout << "Compressed data: ";
    for (const auto& p : compressed) {
        std::cout << p.first << p.second;
    }
    std::cout << std::endl;

    std::string decompressed = decompress(compressed);
    std::cout << "Decompressed data: " << decompressed << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Compression Function (`compress`)**:
   - This function performs a simple run-length encoding (RLE) compression.
   - It traverses the input string and counts consecutive repeated characters, storing the character and count in a vector of pairs.

2. **Decompression Function (`decompress`)**:
   - This function reverses the RLE compression, reconstructing the original string from the vector of character-count pairs.

3. **Main Function**:
   - Demonstrates the compression and decompression process on a sample string.

### Notes on Advanced Implementations

In a more advanced implementation involving Galois cohomology, the compressor would likely:
- Identify symmetries or patterns in data corresponding to algebraic structures.
- Use group cohomology to map data into a more compact form, preserving necessary information for decompression.

However, translating these theoretical ideas into practical code is complex and often specific to particular types of data or applications, usually seen in research rather than everyday applications.
