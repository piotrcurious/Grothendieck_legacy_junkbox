Kahan summation is fundamentally about compensating for the loss of precision that occurs when adding floating-point numbers of vastly different magnitudes. While it's typically presented as a numerical algorithm, we can understand its deeper structure through algebraic geometry and field theory.

## The Field-Theoretic Foundation

In exact arithmetic, we work in a field where addition is associative and commutative. However, floating-point arithmetic operates in a quotient structure that's no longer a field - it's more like a finite approximation of the reals with non-associative operations.

Consider the field extension ℚ ⊂ ℝ, where ℚ represents exact rationals and ℝ the reals. Floating-point arithmetic gives us a finite subset F ⊂ ℝ with a non-standard addition operation ⊕ that satisfies:

a ⊕ b = fl(a + b) = (a + b)(1 + ε)

where fl denotes the floating-point rounding operation and ε is the relative error bounded by machine epsilon.

## Galois Field Perspective

While IEEE floating-point isn't literally a Galois field, we can think of Kahan summation as reconstructing information that would be preserved in a field extension. In a Galois field GF(p^n), every element has a unique representation, and operations are exact.

The key insight is that in floating-point arithmetic, when we compute a ⊕ b, we lose information about the "small" part of the sum. Kahan summation recovers this by maintaining what we might call a "correction polynomial" that tracks the discarded terms.

## Algebraic Geometry Interpretation

Consider the affine space A² over ℝ with coordinates (sum, correction). The Kahan summation algorithm defines a rational map:

φ: A² × ℝ → A²
(s, c, x) ↦ (s', c')

where:
- y = x - c  (compensated input)
- t = s + y  (temporary sum)
- c' = (t - s) - y  (new correction)
- s' = t  (new sum)

This map has the crucial property that s' + c' = s + c + x exactly (in infinite precision), meaning the map preserves the "true sum" along a particular algebraic curve in the (s,c) plane.

## The Correction as a Differential Form

The correction term c can be viewed as a discrete differential form that measures the deviation from associativity. In the cotangent space of our floating-point "manifold," the correction captures first-order information about how the non-associative floating-point addition differs from true addition.

The algorithm maintains the invariant that the pair (s, c) contains all the information needed to reconstruct the exact sum, similar to how in algebraic geometry we often work with objects that are "the same" up to rational equivalence.

## Minimal Polynomial Analogy

Just as elements in field extensions can be represented via their minimal polynomials, Kahan summation represents the "true" sum as a polynomial in the floating-point base:

true_sum = s + c + O(ε²)

where s is the "leading term" and c captures the "next order" correction. This is analogous to how in Galois theory, we represent algebraic numbers as polynomials in a primitive element.

## The Geometric Insight

The fundamental geometric insight is that while floating-point addition destroys the field structure, Kahan summation reconstructs it by working in a higher-dimensional space (the (sum, correction) plane) where the lost information can be recovered. This is similar to how in algebraic geometry, we often resolve singularities by working in higher-dimensional spaces.

The algorithm essentially computes in a coordinate system where the floating-point errors become "visible" as geometric objects that can be tracked and corrected, transforming a non-associative operation back into something that behaves like a field operation to higher precision.

This field-theoretic perspective reveals why Kahan summation is so effective: it's not just a numerical trick, but a systematic way of reconstructing the algebraic structure that floating-point arithmetic damages.
