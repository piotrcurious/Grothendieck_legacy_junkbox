Here's an example JavaScript program that demonstrates how tessellation algorithms can benefit from algebraic geometry, inspired by Alexander Grothendieck's work, to reinvent the Bresenham line algorithm:

```javascript
// Function to represent a line using algebraic geometry concepts
function Line(x1, y1, x2, y2) {
  this.a = y2 - y1;
  this.b = x1 - x2;
  this.c = this.a * x1 + this.b * y1;
}

// Bresenham algorithm using integer arithmetic
function bresenhamInt(x0, y0, x1, y1) {
  const dx = Math.abs(x1 - x0);
  const dy = Math.abs(y1 - y0);
  const sx = (x0 < x1) ? 1 : -1;
  const sy = (y0 < y1) ? 1 : -1;
  let err = dx - dy;

  let x = x0;
  let y = y0;

  const points = [];
  while (true) {
    points.push([x, y]);
    if (x === x1 && y === y1) {
      break;
    }
    const e2 = 2 * err;
    if (e2 > -dy) {
      err -= dy;
      x += sx;
    }
    if (e2 < dx) {
      err += dx;
      y += sy;
    }
  }
  return points;
}

// Bresenham algorithm using line object and point intersection
function bresenhamAlgGeo(line, x0, y0) {
  const points = [];
  let x = x0;
  let y = y0;

  while (gcd(Math.abs(x - line.x1), Math.abs(y - line.y1)) !== 1) {
    const den = line.a * x + line.b * y + line.c;
    const dx = line.a;
    const dy = line.b;
    x += Math.sign(dx) * Math.floor(den / dx);
    y += Math.sign(dy) * Math.floor(den / dy);
    points.push([x, y]);
  }

  points.push([line.x1, line.y1]);
  return points;
}

// Greatest common divisor function
function gcd(a, b) {
  while (b) {
    const temp = a % b;
    a = b;
    b = temp;
  }
  return a;
}

// Example usage
const line = new Line(10, 20, 30, 50);
const pointsInt = bresenhamInt(line.x1, line.y1, line.x2, line.y2);
const pointsGeo = bresenhamAlgGeo(line, line.x1, line.y1);

console.log("Bresenham (Integer Arithmetic):", pointsInt);
console.log("Bresenham (Algebraic Geometry):", pointsGeo);
```

This code defines two Bresenham line algorithms:

1. **bresenhamInt:** This is the traditional Bresenham algorithm that uses integer arithmetic to calculate the next point along the line.
2. **bresenhamAlgGeo:** This version leverages concepts from algebraic geometry. It represents the line using the equation `ax + by + c = 0` (where `a`, `b`, and `c` are calculated from the starting and ending points) and iteratively finds the next integer lattice point that intersects the line. This approach utilizes the concept of greatest common divisor (gcd) to determine when to stop iterating.

**Benefits of Algebraic Geometry Approach:**

* **Reduced floating-point errors:** The traditional Bresenham algorithm can suffer from floating-point errors, especially for lines with shallow slopes. The algebraic geometry approach avoids these errors by using integer arithmetic.
* **More generalizable:** This approach can be extended to work with more complex geometric shapes by representing them with appropriate algebraic equations.

**Note:**

* This is a simplified example to illustrate the concept. In a full tessellation application, this approach might require additional optimizations for performance.
* Grothendieck's work in algebraic geometry is highly theoretical and this example uses a basic application of the concepts.
